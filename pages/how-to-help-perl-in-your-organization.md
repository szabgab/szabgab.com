=head1 How to help Perl in your organization?

=tags Perl, promotion, perception, business

On YAPC::EU there were several talks with a common theme, how Perl is successfully used
in large corporate or governmental environments such as Cisco, UBS - the Swiss bank, 
the Geneva courts, Opera Software and more.

The common theme was that in none of the cases was Perl suggested by management.
Moreover in many cases there were reasonable forces internally that wanted to use something else.

Nevertheless the <b>in-house Perl agent</b> managed to convince the right people that Perl is
the right tool to write the applications.

In contrast we see many cases where Perl is declared as something that you cannot use
for the project. For example the recent post of Todd Presta 
<a href="http://www.asciiville.com/2009/08/the-wings-of-perlception.html">The Wings of Perlception</a>
in which he describes how in his workplace Perl is considered "evil" and is not considered
to some web application. Instead of that they are talking about either Java or PHP.

Maybe it is too late for this specific project but how could Todd make a change in the
attitude?

<h2>Manual for field agents on how to promote Perl</h2>

I talked to some of the speakers during YAPC about the need of some kind of a help for
all the Perl agents in the corporate environment - such as Todd. Some kind of a manual
on how to promote Perl. I talked to them as it seems they all had various tools to
bring Perl into a position in the organization where it is an accepted or even approved
language for development. So they could be the best people to help put together a set of
<b>white papers</b> or ideas on how to improve the position of Perl in an organization.

So what do you suggest, what are the tricks one can employ to improve the position of
Perl in his own organization?
