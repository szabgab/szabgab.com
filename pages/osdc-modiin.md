I was dragging my feet for a long time with this, but since the <a href="http://modiinhub.com/">Modiin HUB</a> has opened
its gates I have no more excuses.

They were kind enough to host our <a href="http://osdc.org.il/modiin/introduction-to-mongodb-the-nosql-database">first meeting</a>,
and let me start to organize regular meetings in the Modiin HUB.

So I am happy to announce the <a href="http://osdc.org.il/">Modiin branch of the Open Source Developers Club</a>.



The name originally came from <a href="http://osdc.com.au/">Autralia</a> where they mostly organize annual conference.
Even in Israel we had such a conference <a href="http://osdc.org.il/2006/">back in 2006</a>, but organizing a conference is
a lot of work with a very short impact.

Having regular meetings requires a different kind of work, more persistent, but the impact can be ongoing. It can also build a community.

At our first meeting on February 23, 2014, I gave a talk
about <a href="http://osdc.org.il/modiin/introduction-to-mongodb-the-nosql-database">MongoDB, the NoSQL database</a>
and I think there were between 20-30 people.

The next meeting will be on March 25, 2014, <a href="http://osdc.org.il/modiin/introduction-to-the-dart-programming-language">introducing the Dart programming language</a>.
(again by yours truly).

Later, probably during April there is going to be a talk about Android. Details will be announce on the <b>mailing list</b> of OSDC-Modiin,
and on various other forums.

In any case, I'd like to invite you to join us on our <a href="http://mail.osdc.org.il/mailman/listinfo/modiin">mailing list</a> and on
the upcoming meetings.
