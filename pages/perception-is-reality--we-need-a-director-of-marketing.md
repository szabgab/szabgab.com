<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/39344">What Does the Outside of 
Perl Look Like?</a> asked Ovid and listed some of the negative images Perl 
probably has from the outside. I commented on his blog but let me write here
more in detail.

When I did my MBA I also took classes in marketing that I barely passed. <br />
So I am an authority to say that

<b>We don't know how to deal with this!</b>

One of the things we learned there is that <b>Perception is Reality</b>.

I remember two interesting case studies. In one case study people were given
two shopping lists and had to rate the women who had those shopping lists.
The only difference was that in one list coffee was listed in the other
one Nescafe. The group whose list contained Nescaf√©, <i>described the woman 
as lazy, unorganized, careless, bad wife and mother</i>.

So the Nescafe addressed the perception and their message
changed to <i>women who buy instant coffee can spend more time with 
their family.</i>

I even found a recent blog post about this:
<a href="http://adwomeninenglish.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-nescafe-convinced-women.html">How Nescafe Convinced Women</a>


The other one was I think about Exon, the oil company. Due to its heavy 
investment in telling about its green projects for it was perceived as one
of the most environment friendly companies.

In 
<a href="http://247wallst.com/2009/04/02/the-%E2%80%9Cgreen%E2%80%9D-hypocrisy-america%E2%80%99s-corporate-environment-champions-pollute-the-world/">this</a>
blog entry I found some comments that would indicate that they are far from
really being environment friendly.

<h2>Back to Perl</h2>

Of course I am not suggesting that Perl is either bad for the environment 
or that we need to be sexists but that changing the frequency of 
releases of perl or changing the language itself won't lead to 
a change in perception. In fact probably we don't need to make any changes
in most of the areas where Perl is perceived negatively? 
(I love the questions of some people: Can perl access web sites?).
What needs to be changed a lot more is the perception.

<h2>Why are these perceptions?</h2>

The other thing I wrote in in that response to Ovid is that because 
perception is reality, you won't really be able to get an answer to 
a straight question of <i>Why do you think Perl is unreadable</i>.<br />
That's just how it is. That's reality. For the responding person.

In any case I think 

<h2>we need professional help</h2>

I think we need someone who has marketing background and who is being paid
to improve the marketing message of Perl. I don't think it can be done
by volunteers of <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">TPF</a> 
of <a href="http://enlightenedperl.org/">EPO</a>. This is not perl coding
we enjoy to do, nor do we know how to really do that.

This person might be employed by TPF or by EPO or by some organization
that has vested interest in the well being of Perl. One of her first tasks 
will probably be a market research finding out what are the perceptions
and what would be good to be as perceptions. 
Such research probably can be done relatively quickly but marketing 
is a long term process.
So whoever sets up such a position needs to be able to commit
to long term work both in supporting and in financing the marketing director.
