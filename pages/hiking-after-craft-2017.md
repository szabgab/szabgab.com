=tags Conference, Hiking, Hungary



If you like nature, nice views, and would like to get away from the city after you've enjoyed the
<a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft Conference</a>, then you are invited to this short hike in
the hills on the outskirts of Budapest.

Date: April 29, 2017. from 10:00 till about 12:00.

Assuming the weather permits.



<h2>Arriving</h2>

We leave at 10:00 from the crossing of Nagybányai út and Törökvészi út at the last stop of bus #11
marked as <b>Végállomás Mini ABC</b>.

You can easily get there from Batthyány tér (square), a major transportation hub in Buda by taking bus #11.

Another place where you can hop on bus #11 is the Mechwart tér which is on Margit krt. where trams 4 and 6 pass frequently.

It leaves ever 10 minutes or so and the ride takes about 20 minutes.  See the map.

<h2>The route</h2>

We will visit the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d-kil%C3%A1t%C3%B3">Árpád kilátó</a> (viewpoint) and the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guckler_K%C3%A1roly-kil%C3%A1t%C3%B3">Guckler Károly kilátó</a> on Hármashatár-hegy which is about 200 m higher than our starting point. On the way we might visit the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1rmashat%C3%A1rhegyi_rep%C3%BCl%C5%91t%C3%A9r">Hármashatárhegyi repülőtér</a> (airport).

We end our hike where the Szépvölgyi dűlő (vineyard) meets the Szépvölgyi út (street). From there we take bus #65 to Daubner cukrászda, which is probably the best Patisserie in the city.
That will help us topup the calories lost during the hike.

<h2>What to bring</h2>

Good shoes that you can walk in a lot. Enough battery in your phone to last the trip.
An apple or comparable fruit. One liter of water. Binoculars.

<h2>Cost</h2>

There are no costs involved except the bus tickets you buy for yourself and whatever you spend in the Patisserie...

<h2>RSVP</h2>

It would be important to notify me if you are planning to join us. Send an e-mail to Gábor Szabó szabgab@gmail.com letting me know
if you are coming and how many other guests are you bringing with you. Just so I have an idea how many people to expect.

I'll also send you my mobile number in case you need last minute communication.
