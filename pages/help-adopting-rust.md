As you might know I am trying to help companies adopt Rust.

In this quest one of the key questions is "what is stopping them?" and if I can help in that area?

Yesterday I asked this question on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ital1t/why_dont_you_use_rust_at_your_company/) and got quite a lot of valuable responses. There were many different responses I am still digging through them. A number of responses pointed out lack of support from certain hardware vendors. This I cannot address directly, but for many people and many companies this is not an issue.

There were also many who pointed at areas where I can help:

* Reducing the learning curve by providing learning material and by offering Rust training.
* Providing help in the transition from other languages to Rust (e.g. Java to Rust, Python to Rust, or Perl to Rust)
* Ongoing support to bridge the experience gap while the team gains that experience.

If you think Rust would be a good fit for your company or at least for your team, what stops you from adopting it?
