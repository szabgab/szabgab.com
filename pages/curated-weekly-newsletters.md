When it comes of being up to date in programming languages some people
have the time to follow <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">Reddit</a>
or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.

Others prefer a less frequent and more filtered way of receiving
their dose of news.

Yet others want both.

In this post I collected 20 weekly curated newsletters you might want to subscribe to.
