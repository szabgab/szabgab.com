There are many people who ask me how could they (financially) support the volunteer work I do and share freely with the public.

Let me list a number of ways:

=abstract end

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/) allows for both monthly and one-time support.
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) is excellent for a monthly or annual support, but you could also "subscribe and then immediately cancel the next payment" for a one-time support.
* [PayPal](https://paypal.me/szabgab) allows you to send me any amount you like.
* [Books and courses on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab) - You can buy my eBooks and courses on LeanPub. The nice thing with LeanPub is that you can pay any amount above the minimum I set.
<!-- * [Courses on Teachable](https://courses.code-maven.com/) - I have a lot more courses available on my Teachable site. -->
* [Follow me](/follow.html) on the social networks, "like" my posts and reshare my work.
