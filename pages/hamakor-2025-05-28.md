=tags HaMakor


[HaMakor](https://hamakor.org.il/) is n Israeli Society for Free Software and Open-Source Code, a registered Non Profit organization.

It is not very active these days, but I think there is a lot of potential in it and a lot to do.

On Sundayat [GopherCon Israel](https://www.gophercon.org.il/) Miki Tebeka, the main organizer mentioned that the average years of experience of the organizers was 22 years (or was that 24 ?).

I am the organizer of both [Python](https://python.org.il/) and [Rust](https://rust.org.il/) related events in Isrel and I have some 35 years of experience.

On one hand it is wonderful that people have experience, on the other hand these activities need younger people as well.

A few things to do.
