Amy Eisinger suggests took on the bright side of life. Either do a Month-by-Month Review or a Life Area Review. You might also create a table. Each column is an area
of your life. Each row is a month. Then go ahead and fill out the boxes. Once you did this, you could revisit this table
at the end of every month and add another row to have the retrospective more frequently. That will allow for quicker adjustment
of your plans. Some of the topics you might want to have in your columns:
Family. Friends. Professional life: Business/Employment. Physical wellness / health. Education. Spiritual life / mental health. Finances.

They could get help from their peers who will be able to remind them about their successes or what was perceived by the
outside world as successes.
