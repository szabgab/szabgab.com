Recently I saw the article of VM Brasseur <a href="http://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2017/01/07/no-i-will-not-lighten-up/">No, I will not "lighten up"</a>
and posted in on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5mpbo7/no_i_will_not_lighten_up_on_bullying_in_open/">Reddit</a>.

The immediate reaction was ranging between plain stupid to straight out misogynist.

Frankly I don't know how to fight these assholes.
I keep swinging between "calling them out" as VM did, to disregarding them "not to feed the troll".

I guess, instead of continuing this rant, let me just try to build more things that will empower
women,  minorities and people who are being attacked in general.
