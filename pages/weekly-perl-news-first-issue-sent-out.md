=tags Perl, news, newsletter, perlweekly

You are busy churning out code or managing the developers. 
You care about Perl but don't have time to go through tens and hundreds of articles 
and blog posts every day. You want to keep an eye on the development of Perl without 
drowning in a sea of blog posts. You need someone to point out the most important 
news and articles in the Perl World.

That's how I opened the first issue.[1]

With this newsletter I'll try to be <b>your guide</b>. 

The newsletter won't provide original content. I am just 
going to send out links with a few words of comment 
to the items that I found most important.

If you are a <b>Perl junkie like me</b>, reading all the posts 
the Perl community and ecosystem produces, then this 
newsletter will just anger you. Why did I include X and not Y?
You are welcome to let me know your opinion.

If you are like the <b>silent majority</b>, having little time
but still wanting to be up to date then, I hope, you will find 
this newsletter useful.

My hope is that this newsletter will serve both <b>"simple users"</b>
of Perl and <b>managers</b> who run teams of Perl developer.

reported by <a href="http://mdk.per.ly/">MDK</a>, thanks!
