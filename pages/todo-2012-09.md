=head1 Report for August and TODO for September 2012
=timestamp 1346752200
=tags Perl, TODO



August was a hot month and I spent a week in Germany. That started out as cool and nice
and ended as too hot.

I also published 15 articles.




<h2>August Penguin</h2>

On 3rd August I participated at <a href="http://august.penguin.org.il/">August Penguin</a> (Hebrew site),
the local annual Penguin festival, where Linux enthusiasts try to flock together.

I was supposed to give a talk <b>Writing Modern Web Applications using Perl</b>,  but I managed
to get <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">Sawyer X</a> to do most of it. Basically
I tried to be funny and showed them a few pictures, then Sawyer gave his regular
<a href="http://perldancer.org/">Perl Dancer</a> talk. Unfortunately this was the last talk of the
day and some people have already left, but in general I think it was good.

<h2>Perl 5 Maven</h2>

I published 6 articles on the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl 5 Maven</a> site. Some of them
were a bit controversial, such as the one about
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/simple-cgi-script-to-send-form-by-email">CGI and sending e-mail with Perl</a>,
but as usual the one that draws the most comments is the article about
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/perl-editor">editors and IDEs</a>.

<h2>Perl 6</h2>

Apparently the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> site also got 6 articles.
This is quite good, especially if we take in account that I spent a week in Germany and then
another 2 weeks trying to recover and get my inbox under 100 messages again.

I think the article about <a
href="http://perl6maven.com/perl6-looping-over-a-list-of-values-one-at-a-time-two-at-a-time-and-more">loops and zip</a>
was read the most.

<h2>szabgab.com</h2>

There were 3 articles. Two of them seem to be the really interesting ones:

I have a dilemma who am I really serving with the Perl 5 Maven site. The people who write
new code and who can afford to use <a href="/enlightened-modern-perl-or-useful-perl.html">Enlightened Modern Perl</a>
or those who need to <a href="/enlightened-modern-perl-or-useful-perl.html">maintain old but working Perl code</a>?

In preparation for the Perl Reunification Summit, I wrote another article trying to
figure out <a href="/the-size-of-the-perl-community.html">Who is in the Perl community anyway?</a>.

<h2>Perl Reunification Summit</h2>

I was invited to the PRS by Liz and Wendy. The Perl Reunification Summit took place between
16-19 August 2012 in the town of Perl in Germany. Near the border of Luxembourg and France.
I should write more about this, but if you are interested what was it about, the best would be
to read <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/liz/2012/08/as-some-of-you-may.html">the invitation letter</a> by Liz.

In a nutshell, the idea was to improve the relationship between the Perl 5 and the Perl 6 implementations while
getting the communities closer to each other. The summit could be seen as the initiation of this process.
We should see solutions appearing during the next few months.


<h2>YAPC::EU Frankfurt</h2>

Immediately after the PRS was the <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/ye2012/">Annual European Perl conference</a> in Frankfurt.
Unfortunately I hurt my leg (probably already at PRS) so during the whole conference I could hardly stand on my feet.
The advantage of this was, that I could talk to a lot of people. Many of whom I met the first time.

<b>The weather was warm. The beer was cold. It was great.</b>


<h2>Some numbers</h2>

The <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly newsletter</a> has now 3800 e-mail subscribers and over 400 RSS
readers.

The <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl 5 Maven</a> site already gets 350-450 visitors a weekday, but it's
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/perlmaven.com">Alexa ranking</a> is still way up at 1,847,251.

OTOH the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> site gets only between 50-100 on a weekday, but is's
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/perl6maven.com">Alexa ranking</a> is actually much better: 1,290,084.
Maybe that's due to the peaks of 300-500 visitors a day when I publish an article. Especially when it is featured
on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/">Reddit</a> or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.

<h2>E-books and videos</h2>

I made little progress with the new e-books and video. Specifically I learned how can I record
a video on my Windows notebook.

<h2>Courses</h2>

I have scheduled two <a href="http://pti.co.il/">Perl courses in Tel Aviv</a> and started to promote it.
This itself took a lot of hours.

<h2>Plans</h2>

The school-year has started which gives me more time to work on stuff alone. That means hopefully I will
be able to publish a few more articles. OTOH in September we have the Jewish holidays (Rosh HaShana, Yom Kippur)
which mean more eating (or not) but definitely school-break and lack of time to write articles.

We'll see.
