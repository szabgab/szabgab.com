It is strange but it is true. At least for me. Restarting is hard.

For a while I have been writing 3-4 times a week, but in recent months I
got so busy with work at clients, with traveling and with various other
stuff, that I did not have the peace of mind to post articles.



I launched the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site with the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/perl-maven-cookbook">Perl Maven cookbook</a>, 
but only posted 2 articles and have not even linked them from the main page yet. It does not even have an
RSS reader, though it has several hundred subscribers.

So now, that I am back from <a href="http://yapcna.org/">YAPC::NA 2012</a>, I got a call from my
client telling me they are delaying my contract for a while. So now I have no immediate work.

On one hand this is bad. This means I don't have income. On the the other hand, as I wrote
<a href="http://szabgab.com/contract-is-finished-life-is-beautiful.html">earlier</a> this makes me happy.
Even though I liked the work at this client, I am happy that I can now focus on other things.

Such as fixing the bug tracking system of Padre, that has been down for a while.
Moving all the other sites to new servers.
Improving my training materials and starting to publish articles again.

And getting more training clients.

Actually I already got two call for training. One in Europe, the other one in Israel.

<h2>Why no articles?</h2>

I have not published anything recently as I kept delaying it. But why?

Every time I sat down to write something I felt I'd like to write something important.
After such a break, I need something big.

Of course, the deeper the article is, the more time it requires to think it
over, research it and write it down.

But every time I tried, I only had very limited uninterrupted time.

I probably should have written just short articles, but it is easy to theorize. Much harder to implement.

The thing is. For every article I need a few hours of uninterrupted time to write something. 

Even this one. Though this does not need that much time as a technical article, but I still need to focus.

<h2>So what's now?</h2>

I got home from YAPC::NA being very enthusiastic about <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6</a> again.
I am not sure why exactly.
I just heard one little talk from Patrick Michaud where he pointed out two things.

The <b>10-fold speed improvement</b> of <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> in the last year
and the fact they plan to provide <b>backward compability</b> or at least an easy upgrade
path within Rakudo. The wording was <b>strong deprecation policy</b>.

That's awesome. Combine that with the fact that I am going to post all my
<b>Perl 5</b> related technical articles on the new <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site.
I think I can start playing with Perl 6 again. I can start writing articles and update my
<a href="/perl6.html">Perl 6</a> material.

I planned to keep those on this web site but I am not sure now.
Maybe I should set up a separate web site for all the Perl 6 related technical content and leave only
the meta posts - like this one - on my personal site. What about "Perl 6 Maven"?

Any suggestions?
