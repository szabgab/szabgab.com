It is a recurring topic that got another push by the OSCON keynote of Skud about 
<a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/07/25/standing-out-in-the-crowd-my-oscon-keynote/">Standing out in the crowd</a>
so let me go over a couple of reasons why I should or should not care about more women in the Perl community.


I did not do any research but I was lucky to find this blog entry of Elizabeth Naramore
about 
<a href="http://naramore.net/blog/gender-in-it-oss-php-and-how-it-affects-us-all-1">Gender in IT, OSS, and PHP, and how it affects us *all*</a>

She points out two reasons:

<h2>Reason #1: Diversity makes us all more creative and innovative.</h2>

Equally-gendered teams are more innovative, and innovation is crucial to the success of open source.

<h2>Reason #2: Help your (future) daughter</h2>

As statistics go the percentage of women in the whole IT industry is dropping.
Reverting that trend can help your daughter find her career 10-20 years from now.
Helping more women to join the Perl community will help more women to get in the
IT industry in general. (I hope).

<h2>Other reasons</h2>

I am sure there might be other reasons as well. Some might even be valid. BTW it is
interesting that there was also a Python related post:
