In order for Perl 6 to succeed, it need books and it needs applications to be written in it.

I have some experience building web applications in Perl 6.
For example, the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> runs on a simple blog engine
I wrote a couple of years ago in Perl 6.

So I am wondering if there is enough interest in the community that warrants the effort needed
to build a blog engine in Perl 6, write a book describing the proces, and maybe even to create
a video series.



The way I could find this out is to run a crowdsourcing campaign and to see if I can
raise enough money to spend the necessary time on the project.

brian d foy managed to raise over 40,000 USD for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6">Learning Perl 6</a>. So there seem to be some real interest in Perl 6.

Let's start this process now. On the 1st of May 2017.

The first steps of the project are the following:

<ol>
<li>Create a specification of the end-result.</li>
<li>Write the first few articles that show we have all the moving parts. All the major prerequisites.</li>
<li>Break it down to multiple milestones where each milestone is already a working and usable software.</li>
<li>Design an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a> campaign to raise money.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Specification</h2>

I've created a <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/6blog">GitHub repository</a> to describe the project
and started to post my thougths.

If you are interested, comment there and/or send PRs.
Designing the project together will help make it better.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

At first galance it seems to be that these are the major technical requirements for building a web application:

<ul>
<li>Build a simple dynamic web site. (A Hello World)</li>
<li>Sending e-mail from Perl 6</li>
<li>Accessing sqlite / mysql.</li>
<li>Password hashing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Crowdfunding</h2>

What should be the persk I give in return to the people who pledge money towards the project?
