=tags Perl, Perl Maven

=abstract start

A month ago the Perl Maven Pro subscription was <a href="/one-year-of-perl-maven-pro.html">one year old</a>.
I outlined some plans back then but unfortunately I could not fully implement them last month.

=abstract end

I managed to publish only 5 articles on the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site. 3 of them were
for the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/pro">Pro subscribers</a>.

On the bright side, all 3 already came with a screencast, and I am a lot happier with the quality than I was ever before.
The 3 articles and screencasts are the following:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://perlmaven.com/pro/comparing-the-speed-of-json-decoders">Comparing the speed of JSON decoders</a></li>
<li><a href="http://perlmaven.com/pro/sending-html-email-using-email-stuffer">Sending HTML e-mail using Email::Stuffer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://perlmaven.com/pro/testing-session-mocking-time">Testing sessions by mocking time</a></li>
</ul>

So how did I spend my time that I could not produce more articles/screencasts?


<h2>Contract development work</h2>

I spent 12 days at a client writing Perl Dancer, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3. I enjoyed myself very much and also learned a lot.
I have been providing development services for this company on and of for 5 years now. I like the people there and the
tasks are interesting. This time I had to build several in-house web applications to allow people to categorize images
and then to provide statistics about the categories. I also built an implementation for the <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>
service. That was basically a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single-Page application</a> where the only interaction
with the server is fetching a JSON file describing the task and submitting the results with a simple form. I did not have write any back-end code here.

Beyond being interesting it is also very tiring. These workdays at this client usually are 11-12 hours long + 1-2 hours driving.
That does not give much time or energy for anything.

<h2>Vacation</h2>

In addition there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavuot">Shavuot</a> which meant two vacation-days for the kids.
We spent one of the days at my cousin in a Kibbutz. I really like being there.

<h2>Perl TV</h2>

I spent an enormous amount of time adding videos to the <a href="http://perltv.org/">Perl TV</a>, including 80 videos from 4
years of the London Perl Workshop:
<a href="http://perltv.org/source/london-perl-workshop-2009">2009</a>, <a href="http://perltv.org/source/london-perl-workshop-2010">2010</a>,
<a href="http://perltv.org/source/london-perl-workshop-2011">2011</a>, <a href="http://perltv.org/source/london-perl-workshop-2013">2013</a>
and all the 67 videos from <a href="http://perltv.org/source/yapc-na-2014">YAPC::NA 2014</a>.
I also watched, featured, and shared quite a few videos and the site got 7,500 visits in June. Oh and Eitan Schuler has started to collect
<a href="http://perltv.org/language/de">Perl-related presentations in German</a>, and even made some improvement to the site.

In addition I tried to promote the Perl TV on <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/06/sort-the-videos-by-date.html">blogs.perl.org</a>,
and on <a href="http://perlnews.org/2014/06/perl-tv-over-300-videos/">perlnews.org</a> with limited success. People seem to still mostly link
directly to YouTube instead of the PerlTV.

<h2>TPF grants</h2>

I spent (or maybe wasted ?) a day collecting <a href="http://perlmaven.com/tpf">information about The Perl Foundation Grants</a>.
and then <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/06/tpf-grants-collected-data-2010-2014.html">posted about it</a>.
It seems that some people were unhappy about it pointing at the existing pages about <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/running_grants">running grants</a>
and <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/completed_grants">completed grants</a>. The funny and sad thing is that I did not know about those pages.
I don't recall anyone talking about them when they were created (I think in 2011) or ever since.

<h2>YAPC::NA</h2>

I also <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/06/watch-the-secret-yapcna-live.html">ranted</a> about the lack of communication by the YAPC::NA 2014
organizers. I probably should have not do that publicly but, I already was angry that they did not organize the trainings in time and thus I could not attend.
And then the organized the trainings but in a way that most people could not attend. (it was too late to get the employers sign them up and to change the flight tickets).
When I noticed the live streaming of YAPC (which btw was great idea and great implementation)
just 10 minutes <b>after</b> I sent out the <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> that was the last straw. It was very frustrating that no one mentioned this
feed on blogs.perl.org so I did. It just got a bit out of hand and turned into a rant.


<h2>EduMaven</h2>

I also published quite a few additional pages on the <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/">EduMaven</a> site.
Mostly about <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/python-programming">Python</a> and <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/test-automation-using-perl/">testing with Perl</a>.
