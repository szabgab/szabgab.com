Many people get involved in open source projects and contribute a lot to a small set of project.

I personally nevert got involved deeply in any specific project besided the onese I started, but I have made minot contributions to hundreds of projects.

I thought in my attempt to get more [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab) I should list all the project where I mad some contributions.

So I wanted to list all the GitHub repositories where I have sent a Pull-Request that was accepted. It could be enhanced to show also the number of PRs that were rejected (closed without merging)
and the number of PRs that are still open.  I could also go further and check the programming langguages, the number of lines changed in each PR, the time elapsed between opening the PR and closing it,
and probably some other stats.

I don't have the time an energy now to implement this, but at least I found this link that [lists the closed PRs that I opened](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Aszabgab+is%3Apr+state%3Aclosed&type=pullrequests).

There are roughtly 1200 PRs. There are also 176 PRs that are still open. Some of those are 13 year old PRs. It is not very likely that those will be ever accepted.



You can use the same URL just replace my userid in the **author** field by yours.
