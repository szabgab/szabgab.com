A collection of public mdbooks to get ideas how to use the project.

Even if you are not familiar with the `mdbook` project you might be familiar with its output. Almost every Rust-related open source book uses it and many books that are not related to Rust.

In the last couple of weeks I started to use it and then started to contribute to the project. One thing I needed was to be able to see how others use `mdbook`. What plugins they use. What configuration options they set etc. That's how the [Public mdBooks](https://mdbooks.code-maven.com/) project was started.

It lists 146 public mdBooks I found and provides some analysis about the.

I believe it can be useful to anyone who is interested to use mdbook and some of its plugins to get ideas from other books.

It can be also nice for the authors of the various mdbook plugins to see who is using their plugins and how?

So, please check out the [Public mdBooks](https://mdbooks.code-maven.com/) and if you know about any other mdbook which is not listed yet, please, comment here, open an issue or a pull-request on our [repository](https://github.com/szabgab/public-mdbooks/).
