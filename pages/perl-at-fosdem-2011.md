<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> is next weekend (5-6 February 2011). 
This time the Perl community has both a Perl stand and a Perl dev-room. 
Looking at the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/track/perl_devroom">schedule of the Perl dev-room</a>
you'll see there are talks about <a href="http://perldancer.org/">Dancer</a>, Template::Zoom, 
<a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a>, 
[dist://Curses::Toolkit], DTrace, <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>, 
<a href="http://www.perl6.org/">Rakudo/Perl 6</a> and more.

<h2>Perl Stand</h2>

A number of people have already volunteered and <a href="https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/index.cgi?events_2011_fosdem">signed up</a> 
to be at the Perl stand. As some of the people are the same who were at T-Dose I bet this time it will be fun again.
If you are around, please drop by and say hi or even help us out a bit.


Having both a stand and a dev-room is a huge step forward from last year and I hope we will be able to 
fill the room. The competition in the other 20 or so tracks is very strong, there are lots of interesting 
talks all over the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule">schedule</a>.

For example there is going to be a PL/Parrot by David Fetter.
Here is an <a href="http://fosdem.org/2011/interview/david-fetter-2011">interview with him</a>.

We'll see.

<h2>Pre-conference beer event</h2>

As every year, this time again there is going to be a 
<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/beerevent">pre-conference beer event</a> on Friday evening.
It will be crowded but it could be a good opportunity to meet with the other Perl hackers.
I think I'll try to be upstairs at a table where there is slightly more air.


<h2>Dancer mini hackathon</h2>

Unfortunately they are too busy with day-jobs to have a full hackathon after FOSDEM but all 4 of the 
core Dancer developers are going to be at FOSDEM. The 3 from Paris are sponsored by the French Perl Mongers
while the trip for <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">SawyerX</a> is sponsored by PEG, the 
<a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a>.
