=head1 New course: Testing in Perl
=timestamp 1611042092
=tags Perl, courses

=abstract start

I was busy during the week-end and recorded quite a few episodes of the new version of my old <a href="https://courses.code-maven.com/p/testing-in-perl">Testing in Perl course</a>.

=abstract end

I ran this course a few weeks ago via Zoom as a client wanted to train their employees so I had to update it.

Now that I am recording it I keep finding even better examples and more places to update the material.

Given that the Perl community isn't too large I don't really expect thousends of people wanting to buy it, but I hope
I'll be able to server a few hundred people with this content.


I also created a <a href="https://courses.code-maven.com/p/perl">Perl bundle</a> so people who are only interested in the Perl courses
will be able to buy that for a lower price than the <a href="https://courses.code-maven.com/">Everything bundle</a>.

I am thinking about adding an option with monthly payment that would include all the courses.

... and I just did that as well.
