=description How to write tests for your application written in Perl and how to use Perl to test applications written in other languages.

Below you'll find the description of the training offered to Perl developers and QA departments
by [Gabor Szabo]("#gabor).

In addition to this three or four day long training on how to use Perl in test automation
I am also offering on-site consulting service to [kick-start](/kick-starting-test-automation)
the test automation system by setting up the framework and  coaching the developers.

## Training: QA Test Automation using Perl

Perl has been used for years in QA for various tasks such as
preparing configuration files before the tests run and parsing
log files after the test. In the past few years lots of extensions
have been added to Perl. Now, in addition to the above tasks Perl
can already be used in all parts of the automatic test environment.

<!--
It can be used to behave like a regular user, move the mouse and
click on buttons on any application running on Microsoft Windows
or to become a web client and test any web based application.
-->

## Audience:

* Perl developers who need to write tests for their applications.
* QA engineers with a background of Perl who need to write automated test to any application.

## Objectives:

* Be able to write unit, integration and system tests in Perl.
* Use the testing frameworks that come with Perl.
* Overview how Perl can be used in automating tests for Quality Assurance.
* Apply Perl in various fields of testing such as Web, Networking, Command line (CLI) and even desktop applications (GUI).

## Course format

The regular length of the course is 32 academic hours including about 50% time for hands-on exercises.
It is usually given in 4 days (9:00-17:00 or 10:00-18:00) but it can be spread to a longer period.

## Prerequisites:

At least 6 month experience as a Perl programmer or taking an
introductory Perl course prior to this class.
(We can arrange to offer those classes as well, if needed.)

## Content

* First we'll learn about the basic tools of testing and the test frameworks available in Perl by looking at unit-tests of Perl modules.
* Then, we'll expand our set of tools in order to test other kind of applications.
* We'll look at testing of

* Web applications
* Command line applications (CLI)
* Network Appliances
* and even Desktop applications with a GUI.

* The test will cover unit, integration, system and even acceptance testing with both white- and black-box testing in mind.
* Topics covered in the training include an introduction to the unit testing framework of Perl using Test::Simple, Test::More and the Test::Builder ecosystem.

After the training attendees will be able to setup their own
testing framework and start writing unit tests to their
applications. They will also be able to develop their own specific
test modules similar to those found in the Test:: name space on CPAN.
Those who already have unit testing in their application will be able
to extend it with the solid knowledge they get on how and why things
work the way they work in TAP.
