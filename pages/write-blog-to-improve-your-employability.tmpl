In one of the recent <a href="https://code-maven.com/job-search">webinars</a> I had this epiphany about the value of writing a blog for anyone in the hi-tech world.

=abstract end

I used to say that is important because a future employer will be able to see the effort of the author and that will make it easier to get hired,
but there is a much more important reason.

Writing articles helps you build up the skill of expressing yourself about the technological topics.
It helps you become a better communicator which is good at any job, but it is getting more and more important
as we work in companies where you are not co-located with all the other people.

Not only that, but better communication skills will help you in job interviews as well.
It will make it easier to find a job and impress the hiring people.

So start writing a blog now!


You can use places like <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, you could install your own
<a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, or if you like to understand the technical aspects more, you
could use <a href="https://code-maven.com/getting-started-with-github-pages">GitHub pages</a>.

If you are really into tech then you will even blog software. It is a great experience.
