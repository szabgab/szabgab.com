=abstract start

I have been investing more and more in Rust in the recent months. It might be time to formulate a plan. A more well defined plan.

Or at least collect my thoughts on the topic.

=abstract end

## Content

* Keep writing blog posts for the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) site. At least 3 every week, but better more.

* Keep adding examples to the [Rust slides](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/). Improve the slide generator to make more SEO friendly pages. (e.g. include descriptions, keywords, etc.). Improve how the slides look like.


## Projects

* [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/). Once a week write and publish a report on my progress with the most up to date data. Send more pull-requests to Crate developers mentioning the Rust digger.

* [Rust Maven SSG](https://ssg.code-maven.com/) - Static Site Generator - Make it more SEO friendly. Add all the features needed to replace the code-base of the [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) and [Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/) sites. Use it for my other projects as well. Make it useful for other people as well.

* [Banner Builder](https://banner-builder.code-maven.com/) - this project was extracted from the SSG.

* [SEO Site Checker](https://site-checker.code-maven.com/) - Work on a program that would analyze web sites reporting things about their SEO-readiness. Start using this process on my own sites and on a few sites that are really good at SEO.

* Visitor logger. A stand-alone project to collect information about visitors to my web sites.


## Promotion

* Improve the images used for the social networks.

* Post in the Israeli Rust groups on Telegram and Discord.

* Post some of the updates on Reddit.

* Post some of the updates in the Rust groups on Facebook and LinkedIn.

* Every few days send out an email to the [Rust Maven newsletter](https://rust.code-maven.com/subscribe) including information about the new articles, new slides, and new information about my projects.

* Every week add at one or more links to the [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) newsletter about the various Rust-related projects I am working on.
