=abstract start

There are a number of different ways I earn money. Each one has its advantage and disadvantage.
In this series of articles I'll go over the various ways I have been earning money as a self-employed,
but I'll also include the possibility of full-time employment.

=abstract end

I do this partially to clarify my thoughts to myself, but I also hope thee can help you as well
if you are thinking about similar topics.
