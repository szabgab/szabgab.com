I already mentioned twice that I'd like to make a point linking
to people who write about Padre (see <a href="/padre-blogs.html">Padre blogs</a> and <a href="/more-padre-blogs.html">More Padre blogs</a>)
but in the end it just boils down to what the title says.

Anyway two more links:
Recently <a href="http://use.perl.org/~tsee/journal/">Steffen Mueller</a> 
wrote <a href="http://use.perl.org/~tsee/journal/38714">How Padre saved my day</a>
and <a href="http://blog.jeremiahfoster.com/">Jeremiah Foster</a> wrote about the
Test Automation Training and the Perl 6 training I am going to give in Oslo.
