=head1 Comparing Perl and Python

=tags Perl, Python, culture

Standing at a Perl booth at technical events gives you a lot of opportunities 
to talk to nice people. They often ask how do Perl and Python compare. I try to
be diplomatic, even if that does not always work. Here is what I tend to answer:

<h2>Size and complexity</h2>

Perl, the language is much larger than Python so probably it takes longer time to
learn Perl than Python but in the end you have a more expressive language.

The standard libraries of Python cover a lot more fields than those of Perl as 
Python has an approach of batteries included while Perl is now following a 
"small core" approach. This makes it easier to distribute simple applications
written in Python as they have a better chance of not needing any 
external dependencies except a specific version of Python.

On the other hand CPAN is the killer feature of Perl. It has a lot more
extensions than Python has. It has a central location with a standardized 
installation process and a standardized way of installing dependencies.

Lastly on the application development level it seems that you can find a lot
more application frameworks and a lot more ready made applications written in
Python than in Perl.


<h2>Approach and community</h2>

That's one direction of comparing the two languages. The other one is the 
general approach to things. Python programmers have the idea of 
<b>There should be one obvious way to solve a problem</b>
while Perl programmers tend to think in TMTODWDI - 
<b>There's More Than One Way To Do It</b>.

This leads to an interesting clash in the cultures. 
People who prefer more centralized governing will tend to use Python and 
think that it is the right way to do things. Seeing people use Perl 
makes them nervous or even aggressive.

On the other hand Perl programmers will think there is more than one 
way to do things. One of them can be Python.

This can give them a much more relaxed approach.

At least I hope so.
