=head1 Embedding Parrot in Perl 5

Continuing with my plan outlined in <a href="/plans-for-integrating-padre-with-parrot-and-rakudo.html">Plans for Integrating Padre with Parrot and Rakudo</a>
I fixed the Parrot Plugin of Padre and even released a pre-packaged
version of Parrot and Rakudo with Strawberry Perl and Padre.
See <a href="/getting-started-with-perl-6.html">Getting Started with Perl 6</a>

I also started to work on making sure that the embedding of 
Parrot into Perl 5 provides the interface I needed. As hacking on 
that would need lot of XS and knowledge and deep understanding of 
how Parrot works I don't think I am qualified to do that properly.
Luckily <a href="http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/">chromatic</a>
seems to be willing to do it some time so in order to help him I
started to write unit tests and started to think about an API that I'd 
like to us. These can be found in the bug tracking system of Parrot under
several tickets:
<a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/77">#77</a>,
<a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/74">#74</a>,
<a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/75">#75</a>,
<a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/76">#76</a>,
<a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/79">#79</a>,

As a separate effort I am adding more examples to the
[dist://Perl6::Cookbook] using Padre as my editor. 
It's nice to have the tool-tips show up while typing the 
Perl 6 code.
