The next <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/">Rehovot.pm</a> meeting is going to take 
place on this Tuesday, 14th December. That is 2 days from now.

There are going to be two talks about Dancer, the Modern Perl Micro
Web-Framework. First <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">Sawyer X</a>, 
one of the core developers of the project, will give an introduction and tell us 
about the good things in Dancer.

Then I am going to show you 1.5 projects in which I used Dancer and I'll complain.<br>
A bit.

There is no required minimum level of knowledge for these presentations.
Sawyer has already given a similar talk in front on the Python web developers.
They liked it.

The meeting will take place in the regular place in the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot.
For more details please visit the web site of the <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/">Rehovot Perl Mongers</a>.

After the talks we plan to go to a near-by place to discuss how we can make
both Rehovot.pm and TA.pm successful and consume some beverages.
