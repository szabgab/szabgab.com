<a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> just sent me their annual report.



According to this in 2021 I moved 969.6 km, worked out 185.56 hours on 179 different days,
but mostly on Thursdays. I burned 86,916 kalories and my longest activity was 12.13 km.

And that does not take into account all the walking between the living-room and the kitchen!

Nor the hikes I tracked using <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/user.do?id=2721120">Wikiloc</a>.
