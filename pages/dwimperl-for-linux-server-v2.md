=head1 DWIM Perl for Linux server 5.14.2 v2 released
=timestamp 1331665326
=tags Perl, DWIM Perl, Linux



I have been waiting with this too much. Let's put an end to it. 

Or maybe a beginning.

Let me announce the first public release of DWIM Perl for Linux server.



<h2>DWIM Perl for Linux server</h2>

The idea is that I'd like to have a Perl distribution that I can 

<ol>
<li>upload to my server</li>
<li>unzip</li>
<li>launch my web application</li>
</ol>

Therefore it needs to contain every module I need for my site,
except the actual application. Things such as <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a>,
<a href="http://plackperl.org/">Plack</a>, <a herf="http://perldancer.org/">Dancer</a>
and <a href="http://plackperl.org/">Starman</a>.

The <b>server</b> part means that it does not contain any Wx thing for Padre...

This is an experimental release. I put it together a few months ago,
but without any good reason delayed the announcement. That means I have
not got any feed-back either. Which I'd like to get so I can make this
really useful to you too.

So check it out. <a href="http://dwimperl.szabgab.com/#linux_server">Download DWIM Perl for Linux server</a>
and let me know what do you think?
