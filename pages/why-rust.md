=timestamp 1741716753
=tags Rust

There are several aspects

## Technical features

* Runtime speed is similar to C/C++.
* Memory efficient.
* Memory safe - it avoids most of the memory-related bugs we encounter in C/C++ code.
* Extensive and expressive type-system.
* Very strict compiler - fixing bugs during compilation.
* Compiler has Very good error messages.
* Integrated package manager, build system, linter etc. [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
* Productivity - [on par with Go, 2x as C++ at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrrH2lcl9ew)

## Corporate Support / Acceptance
* [Rust Foundation](https://rustfoundation.org/)  Amazon, Google, Huawei, Facebook, Microsoft
* Many other corporations support and use Rust.


## Community Support / Acceptance

* [Crates](https://crates.io/) - large ecosystem of 3rd party libraries.
* More than 130 [user groups](https://rust.code-maven.com/user-groups).
* Growing popularity ([TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [PYPL](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html)).
* Most admired / loved language for several years [2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/).
* Admitted to the Linux kernel.


## Drawbacks

* The ecosystem is less mature than for other languages.
* Not enough developers.
* Some aspects of the language still lag behind other languages (eg. Async in Go is easier).
* For embedded systems - not all hardware are supported. Yet.
