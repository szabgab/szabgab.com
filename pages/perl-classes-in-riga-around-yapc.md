I just got notified by the organizers of YAPC that there are already
5 people signed up to my <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3379">Perl Testing</a> class
that will take place on 18th August in Riga.

I guess they also sent messages to the other trainers as well
as <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2011/07/training-riga/">Dave Cross</a> has just blogged about
his classes.

There are going to be a number of training classes:
Dave Cross <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3285">Introducing Modern Perl</a>,
brian d foy <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3287">Surviving Perl Unicode</a>
and Damian Conway with Alex Kapranov <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3267">Speaker Training</a>
on the 14th, the day before YAPC.
Jonathan Worthington <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3283">Object-Oriented Programming in Perl 6</a>,
Herbert Breunung <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3284">WxPerl in Details</a>,
Damian Conway <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3377">Perl Best Practices</a> along with
my class <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3379">Testing with Perl</a> on 18th August, the day after YAPC.

On the 19th Damian Conway gives another class about
<a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3378">Understanding Regular Expressions</a>.

I am very happy to be listed among these high-profile Perl trainers.

As brian, Damian and Dave are all among the best Perl trainers on the globe. They are also
American, Australian and English in that order.
So you might be afraid that it will be difficult to follow my accent. Don't worry you are not alone.
Err. No. That's not what I wanted to say. If in doubt, check out my
<a href="/perl-video.html">screencasts</a> to see if it is acceptable to you.


Anyway, all of these course cost some money but all the prices are way below our regular rate.

Also known as, "it's a bargain".

Oh, and I now see that the <b>Speaker Training</b> is free for speakers. That's great!

Go <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/">sign up now</a>.
