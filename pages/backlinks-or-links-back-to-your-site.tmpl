As coding did not work well, I was in a marketing mood today 
so I wanted to find out which sites mention <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>?
First I searched Google for <b>Padre</b> but it has other meanings as well. I tried
<b>Padre perl</b> which brought up a lot of hits but most of them were just CPAN listings
or my announcements syndicated by various sites. Still I found the 
<a href="http://www.fayland.org/blog/labels/Padre.html">blog entries of Fayland</a>

Anyway, there used to be a feature I think even on Google to find all the pages that link
to a certain web site. The syntax as I remember was <b>link:perlide.org</b>

Ah, and as I write this I just found out why did I think it stopped working. Nobody is linking
to <a href="http://perlide.org/">perlide.org</a> but if I try the same with
<a href="http://www.google.co.il/search?hl=en&q=link%3Apadre.perlide.org">link:padre.perlide.org</a>
it returns <b>22 hits</b>.

I think I still prefer <a href="http://www.altavista.com/">Altavista</a>
that using the same
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?itag=ody&q=link%3Apadre.perlide.org&kgs=1&kls=0">link:padre.perlide.org</a>
returns <b>421 results</b>...
