When I teach git or programming in Python 🐍  or Rust 🦀 I always use the command line. 🖳
This is a bit of a shock to most people who grew up in a GUI-based world and who have never seen a terminal.

After the initial shock, they get in general despair when they understand I really mean to use the command line. 🤯

However, there are a number of advantages of using the command line. Let me just emphasize one. Being able to access the history of your commands
and to repeat a previously executed command exactly as it was executed earlier of with some changes. 📜

Even for the most simple task that involves a single file. In a GUI environment you will have to navigate to the file using the file-explorer
or the open widget every time you need that file. Some tools have a menu option to open "recently opened files", but that usually only lists the 10-20
most recently opened files. It won't go back far in the history.

Besides, what if you need to open a file just next to a previously opened files. e.g. you need to open `image-42.png` after you opened `image-41.png`.

Some tools (e.g. VS Code) offer you a way to type in part of the name of the file and filter through all the files of the project. Which is a nice improvement,
but most of the tools don't have that feature.

With a command line tool you just press the "Up-arrow" a few time till you reach the earlier executed command, you can then edit the command and open the other file.
