In "<a href="/grant-request-for-fund-raising-and-promotional-activities.html">Grant request for fund-raising and promotional activities</a>" I wrote about the need to create a list of 100 companies that would be the first
prospects to contact regarding membership in the TPF Ecosystem Group or Advisory Board. 
If TPF decides to set that up.

<h2>Source of company names</h2>

Several people contacted me and sent me names of companies and I also looked at a number of 
obvious places. Just within a day or so I had a list of 200 companies. (but I got distracted
by some of the comments on my grant proposal so I only blog about this now)

The most obvious companies are those that have been sponsoring one or more of the Perl 
related events in the last 2-3 years or that gave money directly to TPF. The former are
listed on the web sites of the events. The latter - to some extent - are listed on the
web site of TPF.

Then there are also the companies that make money using some Perl related product. e.g. 
<a href="http://www.webgui.org/">WebGUI</a>,
<a href="http://bricolagecms.org/">Bricolage</a>,
<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>, 
<a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a>, 
and <a href="http://otrs.org/">OTRS</a>. For most of these products there are several
companies providing services based on the product.

The biggest source of companies is of course <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a>.
Companies that look for Perl developers obviously use Perl. Some of those might be 
even interested in helping Perl development financially.

There is another great source and that's the list of clients of the various 
Perl training companies. I have not harvested those lists yet as I already 
had twice as many as I was planning for and I think it would be better to
do it in cooperation with the relevant training company.

There are many other places to look for companies, I think there 
must be a few thousands that might be relevant at some level but we have 
to focus on the ones that are most likely to see the benefit.

The companies that are already involved in the Perl community to some level and
the companies that need Perl developers NOW.

I don't make the list public as it already contains contact info 
of a few people but it will be part of the CRM database of TPF. 
If they think it is important to start doing active fund-raising.
If they are ready to pay for the time spent doing it and if they find 
me suitable for that job.

<h2>Update</h2>

In October 2010 the <a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a> was established.
