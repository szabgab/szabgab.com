<a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> started out as a collection of Perl scripts but later it started its own life.
In this section you will find a few articles I wrote about PHP and
resources for PHP developers who are interested to learn Perl.
</p>

<p>
While I'd recommend going through the <a href="/perl-tutorial">Perl Tutorial</a>
I understand that in many cases there is a need for a more direct approach mapping
specific PHP functions to their Perl counterpart or understanding how specific
PHP knowledge translates to Perl. So this page will also contain such information.
