I just saw this announcement on my Google Alert: <a href="http://www.linuxpr.com/releases/11713.html">TurnKey Linux release 40 virtual appliances into the cloud</a>
that brings me to at least two issues:

1) It would be great to see some more Perl applications on those <a href="http://www.turnkeylinux.org/">Turnkey appliances</a>.
E.g. <a href="http://www.webgui.org/">WebGUI</a>, <a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org/">Bricolage</a>, 
a <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> development and runtime environment just to name a few.

2) We should also make use of the <a ref="http://www.linuxpr.com/">Linux PR</a> service to promote some of the applications written in Perl.

3) We might want to setup a similar site for Perl PR though we should think it over why would that 
be better than whatever we have now. Maybe this should be under TPF or EPO and they should actually offer 
this only to member organizations that pay membership fees.
