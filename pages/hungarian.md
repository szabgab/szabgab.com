I learned <a href="/spanish.html">Spanish</a> online and as some of my familiy memebers wanted to learn Hungarian I thought I could put together
a list of suggestions I found on how to learn Hungarian as a second language when you don't live in Hungary. Especially how to do it online.



<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> has a course teaching Hungarian for English speaker.  I used Duolingo to learn Spanish and I played with the Hungarian version a few times. I don't know how good is the beginning part teaching the extra letters and the sounds, but the rest is not bad. There are a number of other language learning apps. Some of them specialize on Hungarian, some are generic that might also have a Hungarian course. Try them.

<a href="https://www.italki.com/i/EFbbfc?hl=en_us">italki</a> has people to have live video-chat with. When I checked in March 2023 there were 62 Hungarian teachers. 59 of them native speakers and 56 of them also speak English. I am not sure how good it is for total beginners, but once you did Duolingo or similar for a few months on a daily basis, it is an excellent way to practice. I personally had classes with more than 30 different teachers. With most of them we had really nice conversations.

I found the <b>podcast</b> of <a href="https://www.hungarianwithsziszi.com/">Hungarian with Sziszi</a> fun, but now that I looked at her web-site again it says levels A2-B2, so it is not for the A1 beginners. (These levels are from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">CEFR</a>).

I found the <a href="http://magyar-ok.hu/">Magyar OK</a> site has some books and audio.

In order to write in Hungarian you need to install the Hungarian language pack on MS Windows or Linux. Some Android keyboard (e.g. I use one called Microsoft SwiftKey) allow you to add multiple languages and that way you can type the <b>accented vowels</b>: a á e é i í o ó ö ő u ú ü ű.

<a href="https://nyelvkonyvbolt.hu/en/shop/books-for-language-learning/language-learning?language=Hungarian">Libra books</a> has a selection of language books.

There are quite a few youtube videos for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hungarian+for+beginners">hungarian for beginners</a>.
