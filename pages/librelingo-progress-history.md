=head1 LibreLingo progress: history and one-file dictionary

Though a better programmer could have probably done a much better job, much faster, but I think I made a reasonable progress today.



In the morning I was complaining about the <a href="/yak-shaving-for-ladino.html">Yak shaving while learning Ladino</a> and then
but then I got to the conclusion that I need to be able to <a href="/measuring-progress-with-ladino.html">measure my progress</a>.

So I put together some code that will collect the number of words and phrases in each one of the LibreLingo languages and created
a json file where I register the status of each course. Based on this I can now generate a page showing the history of the development
of each course.

I also move the whole page to <a href="https://lili.szabgab.com/">a new hostname</a>.
I hope to make it really useful for other people who will want to help with the course development or who are writing other courses.

I wrote and sent an email to the <a href="https://ladinokomunita.groups.io/g/main">Ladino community</a> I hope it will make through the
moderators soon and I hope at least one person will want to help me. It would be awesome.

Yesterday I raised an idea with the LibreLingo developers to be able to write dictionary files in a simpler way. Today I managed to implement
a simple version of it in my own repository. We'll see how that goes.

I also had a Spanish lesson.

All in all, the day was quite productive.

All that because the weather and the high infection level did not want me to go hiking.
