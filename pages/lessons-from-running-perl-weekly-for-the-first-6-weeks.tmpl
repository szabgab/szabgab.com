The idea of the <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a>, an
e-mail newsletter for Perl developers, came after seeing the <a
href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">Javascript Weekly</a> and the
<a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a>.

Now, after sending out 6 issues, let me go over some of the things I learned.

Let me also compare that with what
<a href="http://peterc.org/blog/2010/325-ruby-weekly-lessons.html">Peter Cooper wrote</a>
after running the Ruby weekly  for 6 weeks.


<h2>Subscribers</h2>

After announcing the first issue more than 200 people signed up within 3 days.
(compared with 1120 for the Ruby weekly)
After every issue the number of subscribers jumped again. Usually by
about 100 people a week, though in the last 7 days it slowed down.
As of today there are more than 700 e-mail subscribers and 170
people following the RSS feed.

During the first 6 weeks there were 3,169 visits to the web site.

The top 10 sources are as follows:

<table>
<tr><td>1.  </td><td width="150px">(direct)         </td><td style="text-align:right"> 1,072</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.  </td><td>reddit.com       </td><td style="text-align:right">   348</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.  </td><td>linkedin.com     </td><td style="text-align:right">   259</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.  </td><td>szabgab.com      </td><td style="text-align:right">   231</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.  </td><td>perlbuzz.com     </td><td style="text-align:right">   174</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.  </td><td>t.co             </td><td style="text-align:right">   162</td></tr>
<tr><td>7.  </td><td>plus.google.com  </td><td style="text-align:right">   135</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.  </td><td>linuxinsight.com </td><td style="text-align:right">   126</td></tr>
<tr><td>9.  </td><td>google (organic) </td><td style="text-align:right">   106</td></tr>
<tr><td>10. </td><td>twitter.com      </td><td style="text-align:right">    83</td></tr>
</table>

It would be nice to figure out what is behind the (direct) entry.
Are those people already subscribed clicking on the link in the
newsletter itself? Are those people reading twitter in an external
tool and not on twiter.com?

It is about 900 subscribers / 3200 visits or 28% conversion rate.
As about 68% are "new visits" this means the conversion rate of
individual visitors is 900 / ( 3200 * 0.68 ) = 44%.
I know some people follow the newsletter on the site instead of
signing up. These are the repeat visitors.

<h2>Promotion</h2>

There were several ways I tried to reach the audience.
<ul>
<li>Posted on my own blog about the service.</li>
<li>After every issue I sent out a Tweet</li>
<li>Posted on my Facebook</li>
<li>Posted on Google Plus</li>
<li>Posted in one of the two largest groups on LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

Other people also helped
<ul>

<li>Some people tweeted on their own</li>
</ul>

Maybe I missed a few others. Please send me the links!

<h2>Kudos<h2>

I got a number of positive comments on Twitter. Several people have
tweeted about the Perl Weekly or re-tweeted my announcements.
I got a couple of negative comments on how I asked for re-tweets
which lead me to a little research on how to get more re-tweets.
I'll post about it later.

A few people "liked" my postings on Facebook. More people pressed
+1 on Google Plus when I was posting about the new issues there.
Some people even shared the link.

I got positive comments in e-mail and even on Reddit!

<h2>Perl Buzz?</h2>

There was one question raised by several people whether it is not
redundant with <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/">Perl Buzz</a>.
<a href="http://petdance.com/">Andy Lester</a> also wanted to know
what was missing from Perl Buzz that made me start the Perl Weekly.
This led to a short discussion. Andy has also been
one of the biggest aids in getting more attention to the Perl Weekly.
I hope I can return the favor, as I think what he has been doing is great.

In any case if you need advice on how
<a href="http://petdance.com/book/">Land the Tech Job You Love</a>
I'll recommend his book.

Let me explain here again what I said to several people already.
There are several distinctions between Perl Buzz
and the Perl Weekly.

Andy sends out tweets about interesting articles via the
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/perlbuzz">@perlbuzz</a> twitter account.
He has some 1500 followers there. That's the primary distribution channel.
He also posts the collected links on the
<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/">Perl buzz</a> website.
Occasionally he also publishes his own writing on the website.

The Perl Weekly is primarily a mailing list for people who prefer
that format, though it also allows people to use an RSS reader.
It also includes a few lines of comments for most of the links.

There might also be differences in the things Andy
and I think important to include .

Finally, I think the best answer is from Andy:
"Redundancy is not necessarily a bad thing."

<h2>Testimonials</h2>

This sounds way too business-like and marketingish and we don't
want to go there. I collected some of the comments I got on Twitter
and other channels and put them on the front page. They show
what the readers say about the Perl Weekly.

If you want to be there just send a nice tweet about the Perl Weekly
and I can include you too :).

<h2>Format</h2>

People asked for a text version of the newsletter so now every
message includes both the HTML version and the text version.

<h2>Open Rate - Click Rate</h2>

Peter had that information but as I am still using a simple Mailman mailing list
I don't have such data. Don't worry though I am working on my
own system to distribute the messages that will also allow me to log which links
were clicked and I'll post about that later.


<h2>Compared with Ruby Weekly</h2>

The Perl weekly got 705 subscribers in 6 weeks (+ 160 RSS subscribers)
while the Ruby Weekly got 2173 in the same period of time.
Why the huge difference?

There can be several explanations:

For one, when Peter Cooper launched the Ruby Weekly he was running two
very successful Ruby related sites <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/">Ruby Inside</a> and
<a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/">RubyFlow</a>. They both have some
20-30,000 subscribers.
He posted about the Ruby Weekly there. Compared to that my own blog,
where you are reading this, attracts only a few hundred readers a day.

Then it might be that the fact the Perl community has the <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">Ironman</a>,
the <a href="http://perlsphere.net/">Perl Sphere</a> and <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/">Perl Buzz</a> and
a number of other channels. So there might be less need for the Perl Weekly.

On the other hand if I understood correctly Mark Keating said at YAPC::EU
that the Ironman has 4,000 visitors a month. That's still far away
from the 700 the Perl Weekly has but compared to the 25K subscribers
of Ruby Inside that itself might be an indication that
there are lot fewer people interested reading about Perl than about Ruby.

It could be that the things I select for the Perl Weekly are not that
attractive to many people, though that would probably also lead to
people unsubscribing. That has not happened yet.

It might be that the web site is not convincing enough to get a
higher percentage of people to sign up. I made many changes since
the launch but there are not enough visitors to run A/B test that could
give significant results.

Finally it might be that the way I was trying to
promote the Perl Weekly was not good and I have
not reached many potential readers. Yet.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In any case this was an interesting experience so far, but it was
only the beginning. The real trick is being persistent doing this.
So expect the next issue on Monday.

Just make sure you <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">subscribe to the Perl Weekly</a>.


If you have any comments regarding any of the above or about
the Perl Weekly in general, please don't hesitate to share them.
I even enabled comments without login, as it seem that was
the biggest thing people complained about earlier when I wrote
about <a href="/3-simple-ways-to-help-the-perl-community.html">3 simple ways to help the Perl community</a>

Let's see how this works out.
