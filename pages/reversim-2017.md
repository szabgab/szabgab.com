<a href="https://summit2017.reversim.com/">Reversim Summit</a> is an annual conference in Israel. The talks are almost exclusively in Hebrew, but this year there was a guest keynote speaker from the USA.

Videos recorded at the Rversim Summit in 2017 can be found on the Reversim site under the tag

Due to an accident I could not make public calls for the pre-conference sight-seeing, and even the hike after the coneference
was only announced at the end of the first day so our party was much smaller than expected.

<h2>Sight-seeing in Jerusalem before the conference</h2>

On Saturday, the day before the conference, <a href="http://www.randyshoup.com/">Randy Shoup</a> and myself went to the old city in Jersualem
and spent a nice day there. After we returned to Tel Aviv we ate way too much chocolate at Max Brenner.

<h2>Hike in Nahal David - Ein Gedi and floating in the Dead Sea</h2>

We arrived to Nachal David near Ein Gedi on Wednesday at around 11:20 with <a href="http://www.randyshoup.com/">Randy Shoup</a>.
In the summer it would be impossible to make the hike starting at that hour, it would be way to warm, but in mid-October it was "only" 35 C.
It was also a bit windy that made the hike more pleasant.

We took the same route as mapped here:

It took about 2.5 hours. (Pictures will be included soon.)

We had some sandwitches and finished a bottle of water. Yeah, one needs to drink a lot there.

Then headed over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Bokek">Ein Bokek</a> the "hotel area" in the southern part of the Dead-Sea.
This is an excellent place to swim, or rather float in the Dead-Sea. They also have nice showers so we could wash off the salt.
We spent there about 2 hours and then at around 17:00 we headed back to Modiin where we had a nice plate of Humus and finished off with some Malabi
at <a href="https://humusim.co.il/">Humusim</a>.
