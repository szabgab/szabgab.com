A couple of days ago one of my blog posts, the one about 
<a href="/helping-people-find-good-perl-tutorials.html">promoting Perl tutorials</a>,
was <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3191069">posted</a> on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.

<img src="/img/impact_of_ycombinator.png" alt="Number of visitors per hour" />

That graph was taken from <a href="http://www.getclicky.com/">GetClicky</a>. 
It shows the hourly visitors to my web site. The strong line is the day 
when the article was posted. The other line is from the day before.

That hump represents about 2000 visitors who came mostly from Hacker News while the entry got about 40 points on HN.

This article <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3202189">was posted</a> as well, to see the effect of a recursion.
