A couple of months ago when there were some bugs in 
[dist://Spreadsheet::ParseExcel]
that were making trouble for me I asked for the maintainer-ship of the module.
<p>
I have added some tests (that means now all the test reports fail)
and fixed some of the issues but eventually I must admit I don't have time for it.
So I am looking for someone to maintain it.
