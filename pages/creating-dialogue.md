Some people say that there is a growing gap between Jews in Israel and Jews in the Diaspora in which usually they refer to the Jews in the USA.

The wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country">Jewish population by country</a> has some interesting numbers.
According to them there are 23.4 million jews and more than 50% live in the USA, 30% live in Israel and 20% in other countries.

Anyway, I don't know if the gap is growing or not, but making it smaller is always a good idea. So I just noted a few ideas for myself.



<ul>
<li>Provide an opportunity for diaspora Jews to meet Jews and non-Jews from Israel.</li>
<li>Similar to Italki or Lunchclub where you can meet someone from the other group. Maybe use those platforms.</li>
<li>It can be in order for people to get connected more to their roots, eg. Classes in Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Arabic etc. Language, history, cluture.</li>
<li>Learn and practice Hebrew?</li>
<li>Study the Torah? In general religious studies. Maybe with a secular view?</li>
<li>There could be also just general "excuse" to practice English, Spanish, or French?</li>
<li>Some might be interested to just talk to others on "the other side" but others might need to have a more specific reason. During those meetings about an unrelated subject connections are built. Questions will be raised.</li>
<li>Friendships might be created.</li>
<li>The communication channels become more open.</li>
</ul>
