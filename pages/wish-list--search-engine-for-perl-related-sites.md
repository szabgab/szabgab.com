I wish there was a way to search a bunch of Perl related sites of the higher quality.
The problem is that if I just run a search on Google on some Perl related subject
I get responses of many web site that has very little to do with my main subject.
These might be generic Unix/Linux sites with some Perl content or other places that
I feel should be skipped. I could limit the search to a few (I think 10 or less) sites
but there are more good sites I would include. So I wish there was a site
(search.perl.org ?) that would let you search on some set of highly relevant sites.
Once I started to create such a search engine using
Swish-e but somehow I did not feel appropriate
to go over all those site with their content mostly static.

Maybe this should be done using the [Google API](https://www.google.com/apis/)?
