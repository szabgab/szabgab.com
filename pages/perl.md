## Maintenance and refactoring

If your company still use Perl you might need help maintaining the code-base.

This might involve moving to a newer version of the operating system or moving to a newer version of Perl.
You will certainly want to make sure your code still works even after this move and you will probably want to make sure that the next time you need to move it will be less painful.

In some case it might involve fixing bugs and even adding new features to the code.

Sometimes you "just" want to introduce "best practices" to your Perl development team.

Given that I have extensive experience with Perl, both with old and new code-bases I can provide such service.

## Moving to other language

You might be at a company that feels it is time to move to some other language.
You might want to move to [Python](/python) because it is a lot more popular and thus it will be easier to find well-maintained 3rd party modules and to find developers,
or you might want to move to [Rust](/rust) because you also want your code to be much faster.

Given my deep understanding of all 3 languages I can help your company with this process.
I can help converting the code-base either gradually or in one big development effort.
We can discuss which one fits your needs more.
