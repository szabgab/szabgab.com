<h1>Padre, the Perl IDE - Business solutions</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>, which stands for
Perl Application Development and Refactoring Environment is
a <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Perl IDE</a>, or <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Perl editor</a>
that aims to be the leading <a href="/perl.html">Perl</a> development tool.
</p>
<p>
I have started to develop it in June 2008 and it quickly got some attention from several other developers.
There is a vibrant development community around it that can provide <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/support.html">free
support</a> if that's what you need.
</p>

<p>
In order to make Padre a well supported platform I am providing (via my company)
additional paid services for Padre and for Perl development.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>
You can <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/download.html">download Padre for Windows</a> from the web page
of the project free of charge. From the same place you can get instructions how to install it on
Linux and Mac OSX.
</p>

<!--
<h2>Priority e-mail support</h2>
<p>
While the free support explained on the Padre web site is excellent it does not
always meet the requirements of corporations. People who could answer your question
might be busy when you need the answer. They will most likely support only the latest
version of the software and in general they have no contractual commitment to provide
the help you might expect.
For such cases we offer commercial priority e-mail support.
</p>

<h2>Integration of Padre with other products</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Would you like to connect Padre to the internal information system of your company?</li>
<li>Do you need to connect the development environment to your internal build system?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In any case, I provide custom development for Padre.
</p>

<h2>Fund a feature</h2>

<p>
In the Padre development team our vision is to implement all the features
people ask for either in the core or as a plug-in. Development takes
time and we have to spend a lot of time earning money with other types
of Perl development or <a href="/training.html">training</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are plenty of feature requests already
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/report/1">in the queue</a>
along with requests to fix bugs. We are working
on these and adding further feature requests on a daily basis.
Still, as your priorities might be different from those of the
open source development team it might take a long time
before we implement <b>the features you need</b>.
</p>

<p>
In order to accelerate the development of certain features
you could decide to fund that feature. That will allow me to
direct more of my time to Padre development and implement
the feature you need soon.
