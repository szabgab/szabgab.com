<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a> is getting better 
and better in how it can help the Perl programmer but we have a serious
lack of explanations and demonstrations on how to use Padre itself.



I am very happy that <a href="http://perlwannabe.vox.com/">Peter Lavender</a> 
has  just started to address this issue by adding a new entry to the 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/howto.html">howto page of Padre</a>
on <b>How to get help from Padre?</b> Go ahead, check it out.
People who are using Perl less frequently than you do, but who have
to maintain your code will find it useful to know that even if they
don't remember how to use <i>splice</i> or what does <i>$&</i>, 
<i>$@</i> or <i>$+</i> mean, help is only one keystroke away.
--- <b>Padre can really help you now.</b>

<b>How can you help Padre?</b> Besides sitting down and coding, you can
help creating similar <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/howto.html">howto documents</a>
or you can take the existing ones and create a screencast based on them.

In general we have a whole page on 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/getting_involved.html">getting involved</a> in 
the development of Padre.
