This report is for October 2021 (See also the <a href="/reports.html">list of previous reports</a>).



<h2>Overview</h2>

I am busy and I have been neglecting my monthly reports a bit.

I looked at <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> as I was thinking of building something similar, but with a more business-oriented aspects and without the
requirement of people saying that Muslims face religious discriminated in France. There are plenty of other people who lack opportunities without such requirements.

When I am wonder where did my time escape in October it is good to look back and notice that I worked almost 100 hours for my client. I ran a 5-day online course
at the Weizmann Institute (Programming Bootcamp) and we also had the first meeting of my weekly advanced Python course for Scientists at Weizmann. Apparently
it is <a href="https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/people-and-/weizmann-institute-science-ranked-eighth-world-scientific-performance">Ranked Eighth in the World for Scientific Performance</a>.
I think not bad. I hope some of my students could use what they learned in my classes to speed up their research and data analysis.

The first lesson of the advanced Python course was supposed to be a review of the language, but I figured it would be better to give people tasks. So I started to play
with <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a>. I started to do the Python track, and also a few exercises in the Bash and in the Perl tracks just to see what's going on.
I also wanted to be a bit involved in the development of Exercism and the exercises they have, but it seems to be too difficult to do so. I guess one needs to spend a lot more time
on the platform and on doing small things till s/he slowly understand how things work and till maybe, the maintainers start to listen.

I also managed to read a few books this month.
I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088NG9BKH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o02">Minority Of One: The Unchaining Of An Arab Mind</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/HusseinAboubak">Hussein Aboubakr Mansour</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084GJ78FJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01">Jews Don't Count</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Baddiel/">David Baddiel</a>.

All in all, after reviewing what I managed to this month I think I can be satisfied. I would want to do a lot more things, but well, one can't do everything and I certainly can do
even less.

<h2>Personal blog posts</h2>

<h2>Twitter</h2>

Well, I have been watching Twitter a lot more this month that earlier. Started to follow a number of accounts that either declare themselves
of Zionists or just are talking about Jewish identity. I also started to like and re-share many of their posts and even most some of my own content.

The number of my followers went down slightly, but as I can see the PerlWeekly account lost even more subscribers even though I have not posted there anything.

I primarily posted in my two <a href="/twitter.html">main Twitter accounts</a>.

Number of followers:

  szabgab:      2,430 (-5)
  PerlWeekly:   2,788 (-7)
  PerlMaven:      581 (-)
  Code__Maven:     22 (-)

<h2>Patreon</h2>

Slowly I am loosing my Patrons. Probably due to the fact that I have not posted anything recently to Patreon and hardly posted anything on other platforms either.
I should definitely start posting most content. Even if not specific to Patreon, but to my web sites and various social media channels.

In October the subscriber count dropped bellow 5000. The first time since <a href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/139.html">March 2014</a> when the number of subscribers crossed
the 5K line on the way up.

<h2>YouTube</h2>

  English:   2,350 (+24)
  Hebrew:      223 (+3)
  Spanish:      17 (-)

<h2>Webinars and Meetups</h2>

In these 2 months I had no <a href="https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/">webinar</a>.

<h2>Live Pair programming</h2>

I had no events

These days I do a lot of pair programming with my clients so I have a lot less energy for doing public pair-programming sessions.

<h2>Spanish lessons</h2>

I only had a few lessons via Italki. I tried to have a few new conversation partners, but 2 of them were quite failures. Their Internet connection
was really bad and somehow we could hardly find anything common to talk about. They were both new to italki, so maybe they will improve,
but it did not give me a lot of good feelings. This was the first time I did not give people 5 stars.

<h2>Arabic lessons</h2>

Nope, I stopped that. I felt that the way Duolingo is teaching Arabic is not good for me and I did not have the energy and the motivation to find other sources of learning Arabic.

<h2>French lessons</h2>

On the other hand I started to take the French course on Duolingo. The primary motivation is that my long-term client is actually a subsidiary of a French company and
due to recent changes I might have a lot of interaction with them in the coming months. I thought this might be a good opportunity to see if I can get along with this
language. So far the spelling is really strange - though of course I knew that if possible they are worse than in English in not being phonetic. Spanish is so much easier
in this regard.

Frankly, most likely I'll stop this side-track as well as I don't have that much of a motivation but it is sort-of a fun game.


<h2>Games</h2>

Playing lots of games on <a href="https://www.dragongoserver.net/">Dragon Go Server</a>.

<h2>Sport</h2>

According to <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> I went walking 20 times in October.

It seems the integration with <a href="https://www.asics.com/">Asics</a> does not work very well. I am soooo tired of big corporations ruining good software services.

<h2>Hiking</h2>

If you are interested in the routes and the pictures here is the only hike I had in October:

<ul>
