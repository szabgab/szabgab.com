=tags Perl, CPAN

<a href="http://history.perl.org/">Historians</a> can tell you that Perl was first
released on 18 December 1987. 

It is 26 years old today.


   Hmm, doubtful.  The source code generally wasn't there when I needed it.

   -- Larry Wall when asked if he learned Perl from the perl source


Let me use the opportunity to thank <a href="http://wall.org/~larry">Larry Wall</a>,
for creating it in the first place.

The countless people who contributed to it throughout the years, and especially those
who are call the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl5/">Perl 5 Porters</a> and who
maintain and further develop Perl 5.

Thank those who don't despair, and work on an <a href="http://perl6.org/">alternative future</a>.

Let me also thank all the people who work on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN modules</a>
or contribute to the Perl ecosystem in other ways.

<h2>You are awesome!</h2>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>
