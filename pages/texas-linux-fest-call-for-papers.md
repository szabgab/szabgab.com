=head1 Texas Linux Fest - Call For Papers

=tags Linux, Texas, USA, Perl

I've just seen the <a href="http://www.texaslinuxfest.org/callforpapers/">Call For Papers</a> of 
the <a href="http://www.texaslinuxfest.org/">Texas Linux Fest</a>. It was also announced on
three near-by Perl Monger lists: <a href="http://austin.pm.org/">Austin.pm</a>, 
<a href="http://houston.pm.org/">Houston</a> and 
<a href="http://dfw.pm.org/">DFW.PM </a> in Dallas/Ft. Worth.

This is a one-day, 3 track event with an expected 600 visitors. 
There are sponsor and community stands. I asked for a Perl booth and it was accepted.

I guess this can be a cool event to get together with some fellow Perl Mongers and to enlarge the community.

There is already a coordination page on the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?events_2011_texas_linux_fest">TPF wiki</a>.
