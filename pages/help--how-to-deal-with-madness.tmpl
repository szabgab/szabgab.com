=head1 Help! How to deal with madness?

Two encounters: On our Perl list someone asked for help
and it turned out his manager set <b>a policy not to use strict</b>. On the local Linux list
while trying to help someone I found out that they are using <b>a home made module called DB</b>
for database access which I guess means they cannot use the debugger of Perl as that also lives
in the same name-space.


The <a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2009-September/010571.html">thread starts here</a>,
<a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2009-September/010577.html">no strict policy mentioned here</a>.

The <a href="http://mailman.cs.huji.ac.il/pipermail/linux-il/2009-September/002605.html">thread with the DB starts here</a>

I really don't know how to deal with such situation other than running away. 

I mean, my little children already know they should put on the seat-belts when in the 
car and should not run around with scissors.
