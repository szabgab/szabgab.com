=abstract start

A few years back I used to write almost regular public reports about my activities. Then for a long time I fell silent.

Seeing the monthly reports of <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S Anwar</a> made me feel that I too
might benefit of similar monthly reports.

Normally one should wait till the end of the year to have a New Year's Resolution, but why wait? So I am jumping in. Let's see how can I hold this up.

As this is the first post after a long break let me go back a little bit more in time than just one month.

=abstract end

<h2>January-May</h2>

In <b>January-February 2019</b> I was fully booked at two clients and so I did not have time for any extra activity.
I did teach a one-day <b>Testing with Python</b> training class and I had a remote client for whom I worked a bit.

I had a few lunches with people who also learn Spanish.

In <b>March-April</b> I tried to organize lunches for DevOps people. The first one attracted several people, but then they quickly disappeared.
It seems the idea or the implementation was not that good.

In <b>May</b>, after spending many months at Twiggle providing them DevOps work, finally I figured I could ask them to host my
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/">Workshop Meetups</a>.
(The ones I have stopped doing when I got too busy with work and when Google closed its campus for renovations.)
Talk about being slow thinker.

I had a few <a href="/workshops.html">workshops</a> there.

The first workshop was about <b>Fixtures and Test Doubles in Pytest</b>. I used this opportunity to prepare <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QddQcqa19zo">my talk for PyCon Israel</a>.

I also spent about a week in Budapest visiting my mother and attending the <a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft Conf</a> where I organized the
BOFs and <a href="/hiking-after-craft-2019.html">a hike after it</a>.

<h2>June-August</h2>

In <b>June</b> we had <a href="https://pycon.org.il/2019/">PyCon Israel 2019</a> where I was a speaker, organized the BOFs and the social event.
Otherwise I was fully booked. I also had a workshop called <b>Getting Started with Google Cloud</b>.


In <b>July</b> too I was fully booked so I did not have a lot of time for other things.
I still managed to have a Workshop: <b>Getting started with Docker</b>.

Actually it was so popular I had to run it twice. The second time so many people arrived that we could not fit them in the meeting room so I had to use the kitchen.
That was not received too well by the administration at the company so I felt I should stop organizing my workshops there.
Luckily not long after that I found out that the new Google Startup Campus has a class-room that can fit 24 people and it is practically next door.
So from September I started to organize the workshops there.

In <b>August 2019</b> we spent 10 days traveling in Iceland. It was a bit tiring to drive more than 2500 km even for 3 drivers, but it was a fantastic trip.
Indeed Iceland has really special views.

Because of the trip I only spent 15 days at my clients and I did not have any Meetup/Workshop organized.

Looking back the whole year almost all the months I was full booked at my clients. Setting up CI systems, helping with DevOps and helping with Automation in general.

<h2>September-October</h2>

In <b>September 2019</b> I was full booked at two of my clients and also ran a 5-day long <a href="https://hostlocal.com/eng/bootcamp-for-scientists"><b>Programming Bootcamp for scientists</b></a>
at the <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/">Weizmann Institute of Science</a>. I always enjoy teaching this course. It is very hard, but it is such a great change
from teaching people who are in the hi-tech world.

I also had my first (two) Workshops at the new <a href="https://www.campus.co/tel-aviv/en/">Google Startup Campus</a>.
The topic was <b>Getting Started with Golang</b> and two weeks later <b>Getting started with Data Science for non-programmers</b>.

While I was teaching in the Weizmann Institute I got a nasty surprise. One of my clients sent home all its employees and of course all the freelancers as well.

OK, so I was expecting my contract to end soon, but I was surprised of the timing. On the eve of Rosh HaShana.

<b>October 2019</b> was full of holidays and I've also spent a few days visiting my mother in Budapest so I would not have time to my client much anyway.
So on the few working days we had in the month I worked and I also had another 5-days long course at the <b>Weizmann Institute of Science</b>.

While in Budapest I've recorded the first few episodes of my new <a href="https://he.code-maven.com/podcast">Hebrew podcast</a>.

I had two workshop this month. The first on <b>Getting started with Git</b>, the second one called <b>Your First Open Source contribution</b>.
This was the first event where I used my pre-recorded videos. It was an interesting experience. I'll write about the workshops at another time.

<h2>November</h2>

In <b>November 2019</b>, that is last month, I ran again the <b>Getting Started with Data Science for non-programmers</b> workshop, but this time it was in Haifa.
It was a live presentation as usual. Some 50 people attended. It was actually really nice traveling to Haifa and spending some time there. I should probably do it
again later on.

In Tel Aviv, in the Google Campus I had 4(!) meetings with pre-recorded presentations. The title of all of them as <b>Learning Python Programming</b> and I kept
adding more and more videos each week. There were about 15 people at each meeting. A little  less than I was hoping for, but I do these meetings on Thursday evening.
As you might know that's the last working day of the week in Israel (Friday and Saturday are the weekend). So I guess it is not surprising the room is available
for me every week.

I've also managed to organize two short (4 hours each) <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Israel-Hiking-outdoor-fans/events/past/">hikes</a> in near-by places.
That was a nice change after a long break.

I only spent 10 days at my clients, but the rest of the time was spent well. I have recorded a lot of videos for my Python workshops and updated the
<a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> site to have multiple languages and to support the private accounts on the
<a href="https://he.code-maven.com/">Hebrew version</a> of the site. The videos are primarily in Hebrew for now thought there were a few in English as well.

I've also managed to update my new <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/slider-py">Slide generator code</a>. It can now handle almost everything the old
code could. So soon I'll be able to convert all of my old XML-based slice code to Markua-based code and thus I'll be able to put all of the
<a href="https://github.com/szabgab/slides">on GitHub</a>. That will also allow me to automatically convert them to books on <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab">Leanpub</a>.

<h2>Future</h2>

The short term lookout is good. I already have 10 <b>Advanced Python</b> training days booked between 18 December - 2 February.
I also have two courses booked at the Weizmann Institute of Science in February and March. (<b>Python programming bootcamp for Scientists</b>).
In addition I have a client where I am going to spend about 16 days in January February 2020.

That leaves me quite a few days to record videos, improve the Code-Maven site and get it ready to start selling subscriptions again.

<h2>Spanish</h2>

I have been <a href="/spanish.html">learning Spanish</a> every day 20-30 minutes using <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, reading books (appropriate to my level of Spanish),
listening to podcasts and even having lessons via <a href="https://www.italki.com/i/EFbbfc">italki</a>. I also had the occasional lunches with other Spanish learners.
I think I made a nice progress, but actually in the last few months I slowed down. I spent less time learning and I had nearly no classes. I have to change that and put more
time and energy into it again. Let's say I should start having a weekly lesson again so my speaking ability improves.

On the other hand recently I've started to supplement my Spanish studies with some German. I know some, but never could really speak. I would like to see how does this work out now
using Duolingo and later maybe lessons via italki.
