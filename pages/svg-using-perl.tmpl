On the last Rehovot Perl Monger meeting Tamir Lousky talked about the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVG/">SVG Perl module</a> and how to 
use Perl to produce really nice Scalable Vector Graphics.

While we had some initial technical difficulties Tamir showed us a number of really nice pictures.
He first explained to us the differences between raster and vector graphics and how they both work.
Then he showed us some XML files - after all SVG defines the graphics in XML format - and some
Perl code that can generate the XML files in a more Perlish way.

His slides are available on the web site of the <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/">Rehovot Perl Mongers</a> under
<a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/slides/SVG_PM.odp">SVG using Perl by Tamir Lousky</a>

I typed in the example he gave:

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use SVG;

  my $svg = SVG->new(
    width  => 200,
    height => 200,
  );

  my $grp = $svg->group(
    id => 'group_y',
    style => {
      stroke => 'red',
      fill   => 'green',
    },
  );

  $grp->circle(
    cx => 100,
    cy => 100,
    r  => 50,
    id => 'circle01',
  );

  print $svg->xmlify;


Installing the SVG module on Ubuntu GNU/Linux 9.10 was quite easy. I just typed
cpan SVG and it got installed.

Then I could run the above script and save the output in a file:

  perl red_green_circle.pl > red_green_circle.svg

The result is a simple red circle with green filling visible here.

I enjoyed the talk very much and learned a new toy I can play with.
