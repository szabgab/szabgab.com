It does not have a lot of meaning, but it is fun to know that the
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/perlmaven.com">Alexa ranking</a> of
the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site just reached
and passed the position where the Perl 5 Maven site was, just before
I <a href="/to-merge-or-not-to-merge.html">merged them</a>.

It took 4.5 months.



The Alexa ranking of <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perlmaven.com</a> is currently
355,683 (not really a valuable number), but it is a better position than
the 362,104 where perl5maven.com was the day
<a href="/comparing-perl-python-ruby-and-php.html">before the domain name switch</a>.

The actual number of visitor has already surpassed the pre-merge level
<a href="/three-month-after-domain-name-change.html">2.5 month after the merge</a>,
but Alexa has its own magic (and slightly broken) way to measure traffic,
and it compares the site to others.
