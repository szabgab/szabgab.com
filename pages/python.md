## Introducing Best practices

Your team is probably focused very much on the development of your product. They don't have time to keep up with the changes in Python and the Python ecosystem.
Once in a while you'll want to introduce some of the new "best practices" to your team.
This can be writing Object Oriented code or using functional paradigms. It might be adding (unit)tests or adding type annotations.

I can help teams get up-to-date, introduce industry-wide best practices both with hands-on work and by teaching the team members.

## Helping to move faster and safer

The key to making your team move faster is a tight feedback loop. The sooner they can verify that everything work and the sooner they notice
if there is a problem with the changes they made, the faster they can fix it, the faster they can move on to the next task.

For the tight feedback loop you need automated tests that can run fast, you need standardization in the code-base, linting, type-checking and a CI system that runs it all.

I can help setting up and developing these and I can also teach your team members to continue running with these new tools.
