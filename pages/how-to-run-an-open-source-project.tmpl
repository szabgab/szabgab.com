I still need to continue my notes I started to take in <a href="/padre--the-journey-1.html">Padre - the journey I.</a>
but for now I thought I'll look around what do other say about how to manage
an Open Source Project.

Earlier, while I have been involved in projects its mostly either small things
I did alone or projects where I was a was not paying too much attention
to how people lead it. Actually I see a bit how the 
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl5/">Perl 5 Porters</a> work, 
how Pugs was developed. 
I even looked at the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
development for a while but they are really all so different.

I was looking for something that already collects the wisdoms of others.

First I searched for "how to lead an open source project" but it did not
bring be the expected results. The next search was 
"how to run an open source projects" that already 
brought me some interesting content.

Here is what I found so far.

A few short notes especially related to the development side by
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/turbogeek/archive/2004/09/how_do_you_run.html">Daniel Brookshier</a>

The <a href="http://cbas.pandion.be/2008/08/how-to-run-open-source-project.html">slides of Sebastiaan Deckers</a>
can be flipped through though I'd like to hear or read the actually talk. The points cover a lot
more areas beyond just the development such as licensing and promotion. It would be nice to
see this expanded.

<a href="http://adam.blog.heroku.com/past/2008/9/6/how_to_run_an_open/">Adam Wiggins</a> has collected
some tidbits from <a href="http://www.producingoss.com/">Producing Open Source Software</a> by Karl Fogel.

That's great. For some time I was following the Subversion project and when
people ask me about how Open Source projects are managed (what do they think?)
I often point at Subversion as a project with very tight and strong management.

So that's it. I should be reading this book now.
