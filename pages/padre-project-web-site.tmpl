As I mentioned earlier I have started to develop and IDE
for Perl called <a href="/padre.html">Padre</a>.
It is still in its early stages but now finally it has its own
version control and bug tracking system.
I have setup Subversion and Trac to manage
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> and released v0.04
from the new site already.

Now it would be time to get some more people interested
in contributing to the project. So go ahead. Download
and install [dist://Padre] from CPAN,
sign up on the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">web site</a>,
report bugs,submit feature requests and start coding.
