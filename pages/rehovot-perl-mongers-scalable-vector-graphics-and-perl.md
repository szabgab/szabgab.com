The next meeting of the Rehovot Perl Mongers will take place on 13 April 2010 in our usual place in the Weizmann Institute.
This time Tamir Lousky will talk about the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVG/">SVG Perl module</a> and how to 
use Perl to produce really nice Scalable Vector Graphics (the opensource alternative to Flash / Illustrator graphics).

As usual we meet at 18:00 but the actual talk will only start at 18:30.

People who have not been to any of our meetings are also very welcome. If you think about coming but don't know anyone 
else in the group, feel free to get in touch with <a href="/contact">me</a> even before the meeting so I can help 
introduce you to the other participants.

Regarding the content. I am not sure I'll have time learning about SVG before the meeting but a quick search lead me to 
a very old article on <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/07/11/creatingsvg.html">Creating Scalable Vector Graphics with Perl</a>
and to the <a href="http://www.roitsystems.com/tutorial/">SVG Perl tutorial</a> written by the author of the module. 
You might have some time and try it out even before the meeting.

For further details please see the web site of the <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/">Rehovot Perl Mongers</a> and feel free to join our mailing lists.
