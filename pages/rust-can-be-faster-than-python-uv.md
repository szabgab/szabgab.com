![uv is faster](/img/uv-is-faster.jpeg)

While preparing one of my presentation for the **Rust** meeting today I thought I should find some indications of where **Rust** might be a good choice.

There are two command lines tools used by Python programmers that got Rust-based alternatives. One of them is uv, which can install dependencies just like pip and other tools.

As you can see uv is much faster than any of the other solutions.

Of course it does not mean that one should abandon Python and switch to Rust. It just shows that if speed matters then Rust might provide a very good alternative.

This graph was taken form the web site of the [uv project](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

I also posted some "selling points" of Rust in the [why Rust](https://szabgab.com/why-rust) article and the slides ofmy [Why Rust presentation](https://rust.code-maven.com/books/why-rust/).
