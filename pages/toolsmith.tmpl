<h2>Perl as a second language</h2>
<p>
There are many cases when programmers in Java, C, C++, C#, VB or any other languages
need a tool to solve some issue quickly. As the solution is not part of the application
it does not need to be written in the same language. In many cases these problems Perl
fits much better in solving these problems. Hence I am trying to collect a bunch of these
examples with solution so programmers can get ideas.

<h2>Problems and (sometimes) solutions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Converting (lots of) Microsoft Word documents to XML files</li>
<li>Validating an e-mail address, parsing and splitting an e-mail address:

<li>Sending e-mail in Hebrew:

<li>Parsing Visual Basic:<br>
There is a VB file containing Functions and Subs.
In each subroutine and function I need to identify if the 
string "On Error" exists and if not add it.
