=head1 What are the Perl Monger groups for?

In the age of <a href="http://perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, 
<a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">IronMan</a> and plenty of <a href="http://lists.perl.org/">topic specific Perl mailing lists</a>
I wonder what do you people see as the value of the (location specific) <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a>?

There are plenty of web forums and generic mailing lists where
people can get answers to their technical questions in English and
probably also in the other major languages as well.

I can see an advantage of the Hungarian Perl mailing list as some
people there don't speak any other language than Hungarian and
even some of those who can read English have hard time expressing
them in English.

OTOH the Israeli Perl mailing list is in English anyway for several
reasons. One of them is that it is hard to write plain text going
right to left with embedded code going left to right. So there does
not seem to be any advantage to use it. (Even though I am sure there
too, are several people who have hard time expressing them in English).

There are a few things I can think of:

<b>Coordination of events</b>. If you have face-to-face meetings those 
are usually very location specific. 

<b>Distribution of news</b>. While people can go and read Perl related news
on plenty of feeds, many still don't do. The local groups can pick specific
items and distribute them among their members. There are currently
about 250 Perl Monger groups. If on average they have 50 members 
then sending out the call to participate in the 
<a href="http://survey.perlfoundation.org/">Perl survey</a> could 
easily reach 12,500 people.

<b>More comfortable</b>. I think most of the people are more comfortable when
talking in small groups with friendly faces. Asking a question on a very public
web forum might be intimidating to many people. Asking the same question in 
your local mailing list might a bit easier. Especially if you know some of 
the people involved. Which leads us (back?) to the face-to-face meetings.

<b>Communicating with local companies</b>. One of the biggest things IMHO we in the
Perl community are not doing well enough is talking to companies using Perl.
We should ask the managers (CTOs, VP RnDs, CEOs) what do they need that
we can help them solve. The local Perl Mongers could do that much better
than <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> with 
its limited man power.


<b>What do you think?</b> What are the values in the Perl Mongers?
What do you think the Perl Mongers could do more or better?
