I know I am far from being a celebrity but it is still nice to see that the videos and
screencasts on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/gabor529) has just passed 100,000 views.

=abstract end

It was created on May 19, 2007 so it seems it took just a bit more than 8 years, but of course for a long time I had
no, or very few videos there.

Today there are 190 videos in the channel including 117 of the
[Beginner Perl Maven video course](https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course),
10 [interviews](https://perlmaven.com/search/interview),
8 [videos about Perl 6](/perl6), and a few more about Perl 5.

There are also 717 subscribers, though I don't know if that means much. Do subscribers get notified when
I upload a new video?

In the last 28 days there were 5,115 views and the estimated minutes watched was 12,337.
