I always have trouble finding links on PayPal so I collect the ones I might need.


* [Recurring payments I pay](https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/autopay/)

* Recurring payments I receive
    * [Recurring payments dashboard](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_merchant-hub) (legacy page?)
    * On each payment there is a link to a page where I can also cancel the subscription.

* [Dispute resolution](https://www.paypal.com/disputes/dashboard/)
