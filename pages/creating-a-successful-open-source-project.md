=head1 Creating a successful open source project

People write and contribute to open source for various reasons. My main reason 
to start writing an <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">IDE for Perl</a> was to help people: 
Both beginners and people 
who don't know much Perl or who need to maintain large or just old projects.
I'll use it as an example to go over the various aspects of making a project successful.

For me it is important that the product will be used by many people and that 
it will make them happier. For me, in the context of Padre, that's success.

That means it is not enough to just write the code. It is also important to make 
sure people who could benefit from it can find it and use it. So I need to look at 
it in a way somewhat similar to how a company looks at a product.
I pulled out my marketing book from my university studies. 
Surprisingly it looked unfamiliar. Then I remembered
I got 60 on my marketing exam. The lowest mark that still let me earn my degree.

I recall something called the <b>the 4 P-s</b>. (<b>Product, Price, Place, Promotion</b>).
I looked it up and it can be 
found on Wikipedia under the title 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix">Marketing mix</a>. I'll go over 
the items as they are related to the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> project.

<h2>Product</h2>

AFAIK most of the open source projects focus on this part only.

We have built the product. It is quite good already. Sure there are areas of improvement 
and there are even important areas that need a lot of work. In general the product is quite good.
Thanks to the 50+ people who were involved in the project.

We will certainly need to make further adjustments and we will need to invest a 
lot more energy in the development but the most important of the Marketing mix 
we have done. We have a good product.

Of course I know it does not fit everyone. I know for example that people 
using vi or emacs will have a hard time to adjust to the more Windows-like editor. 
I also know there are many people for whom Padre would be of great help. 

<b>Installation</b>

For <b>Windows</b> it is solved now in a reasonably good way as we have a Windows installer.

For <b>Linux</b> it is partially solved as the major distributions carry a version of Padre. Unfortunately
in some cases their package is broken and naturally it always lags behind the source-code
releases of Padre. People can install the most recent version of Padre relatively easily but it 
still requires spending some time.

On <b>Mac</b> the situation is quite bad as Padre can only be installed manually.

While the mostly potential users are on Windows, these issued need to be addressed on 
Linux and Mac as many of the vocal people are using those platforms.

<b>Tutorials and documentation</b>

A couple of months ago we started to collect a list of all the 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Features">features of Padre</a> 
and started to describe them on our wiki. This work needs to be continued and 
presented in a better way.

I have made a few screencasts showing features of Padre. I should make a few more
describing all the features. That will also help me find out if I missed some of them :)

<h2>Price</h2>

Price is a funny thing. We don't charge anything for Padre. It is free. Both as in 
<b>free beer</b> and as in <b>free speech</b>.
I am just not sure if it is always a good thing? I know many people, especially in the corporate
environment, who would value it more if it cost them money.
Anyway. We have a price and it is 0 USD. 

There is however another <b>cost factor</b> besides the actual purchase price.

It is the time the customer needs to spend with installation, learning to use the product 
and on maintenance. In many open source projects this is higher than in their 
shrink-wrapped proprietary counterpart. For Padre this boils down to ease of installation,
tutorials and good documentation.

<h2>Place</h2>

Traditionally this referred to the location of the store to make it convenient 
for the customers to visit and buy the product. In a supermarket setting this referred 
to the location of the product on the shelves. Who can put its sweets next to the counter 
where people are waiting with small kids?

On the Internet the physical location is not relevant but it is very 
important to make sure it is easy for the customer to find the product and 
it is convenient to purchase / download and install it.
(In our case purchase is irrelevant.) Download and install was already mentioned 
under product.

So what remains is to make it easy for the potential users to find Padre. That brings us to
the last of the 4 P-s:

<h2>Promotion</h2>

We would like to make sure people who are learning Perl will see Padre very early.

That means we have to make sure Padre is <b>featured on <a href="http://learn.perl.org/">learn.perl.org</a></b>
and maybe also on <a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a>. For that we need to make 
sure it's worth the attention of the maintainers of those sites.

People who learn Perl will look for a tutorial. So we should build a <b>free tutorial for 
learning modern Perl</b>. I already started it using both screencasts and blog posts.
(see <a href="/modern-perl-5-tutorial-part-01.html">Install Perl, print Hello World, Safety net (use strict, use warnings)</a>) This needs to be expanded and made it good enough to be 
features on the main page of learn.perl.org.

In addition we will need to find other channels where people - not yet familiar with
the Perl community - are looking for information about Perl. That's a much longer job
and it will include using various social networks.

Lastly, many people get recommendations from friends who are already experts in Perl.
Previous <a href="http://perlide.org/poll200910/">polls</a> and surveys showed 
that a large part of the Perl community is using vi or emacs. I know they won't switch
to use Padre but at least some of those understand that for many people vim and emacs
are not the best choices. Especially when they are learning. (You don't want people to
be distracted by the editor while they are learning Perl, do you?)
Some of the hard core vim users told me:

<b>Probably I won't use Padre but I see its value and I'll recommend it to others.</b>

That's the message I would like to see echoed in the Perl community.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

So there are a number of things to do. They are quite interconnected. 
Luckily while I enjoy coding Padre I also enjoy the promotional activities
such as creating screencasts.
