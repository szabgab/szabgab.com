=tags Perl, tutorial



In the last couple of days I was quite busy but if you are following my blog you have not seen anything happening.

I set up the new <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> site and the almost new
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl 5 Maven</a> site.



Started to move over the Perl 6 related material to the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a>
site and not surprisingly the Perl 5 related materials to the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl 5 Maven</a>.
For every page I move, I add a redirector, so links hopefully won't be broken on szabgab.com but for a while there
will be lots of cross-link, till I manage to move all the pages.

I have also started to add new content to both sites.

On the Perl 6 site, I even included the documentation of the available Perl 6 modules.
We'll see where does that lead us.

Both sites have newsletters. If you are interested in the posts I am publishing there,
please remember to sign up to the respective lists.
