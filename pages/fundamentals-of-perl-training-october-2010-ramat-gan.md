=head1 Fundamentals of Perl training in October, 2010, in Ramat Gan
=timestamp 1282533231
=tags Perl, training, Israel

After a long period that I was giving only on-site classes finally I decided that it might be time
to start offering the "public registration" classes as well.

It is a lot more work to organize such class as I need to be in touch with several customers and there 
were cases when people cancelled their participation in the last minute but recently several companies indicated
that they would like to send 1-2 people to such class so I hope it won't be that hard 

The syllabus of the <a href="http://pti.co.il/fundamentals.html">Fundamentals of Perl</a> training is on the web site
of <a href="http://pti.co.il/">PTI</a> but actually the whole <a href="/fundamentals-of-perl">material</a>
can be found on my web site.
