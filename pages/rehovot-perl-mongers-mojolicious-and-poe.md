and <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">Sawyer</a>: <a href="http://poe.perl.org/">POE</a> - Event-based, multi-tasking framework for Perl

The meeting will take place in the usual place in the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot but we had to move it a week earlier so it will take place on the
<b>9th November, 2010</b>.
