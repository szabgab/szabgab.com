Some of these languages might have multiple Reddit communities and some have only one. This will have an impact on the number of each community.

I've also included HTML and SQL, just to allow people to debate if they are programming languages and a few things that seemed interesting proxies.

These days my primary interest is [Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/).
