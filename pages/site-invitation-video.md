On June 4th, 2020, that is almost 2 months ago I recorded a short video explaning a bit about the <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code-Maven website</a>
and inviting the viewers to follow the <a href="https://code-maven.com/youtube">YouTube</a> channel.

I dit the same for the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven site</a> with a video published on May 13, 2020.

=abstract end

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICPPLV_FQso">Code-Maven video</a> got
2,800 views, 13% watched the whole 2 minutes, the average view dureation was 0:31, 26.7% of the viewers watch that much.
The End screen element click rate was 1% (while the channel average is 2%) they both seem to be very low
but I have not comparision.

I gained a total of 3 subscribers.

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr3SSEjdpgg">Perl Maven video</a> got 1,100 views. 24% watched till the end of the 1:27 min long video.
Average view duration was 0:39 and 45.3% of the audience reached it.
It does not have the End screen statistics as the video was unlisted and so the end screen did not work. I made the video public now. On July 25, 2020.

It brought 5 new subscribers.

<h2>Problems</h2>

Accroding to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google Lighthouse</a> the embedded YouTube video makes the site
load slower. So I looked for a way to avid this problem. I wrote some JavaScript that will add the embedded video only a few seconds after
the page was loaded. This solved the loading problem and as this video is at the bottom of each page, the users won't even see it till
they scrolled all the way down.

Actually a very small percentage of the site visitors looked at the video and an even smaller percentage subscribed to the YouTube channel.

Either I need to improve the videos, or maybe I should remove them from the site and conclude that this does not work.
