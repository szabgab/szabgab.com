=head1 Shall I enable some form of track-back or commenting?

Especially in response to <a href="/perl-needs-is-number-and-similar-functions-nearly-built-in.html">Perl needs is_number and similar functions (nearly built in)</a> several people complained that 
I don't allow comments or not even 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">trackback</a> and they have
to write in their own blog and mail the link to me.

The truth is that my blog is totally home made and I am not sure I am going
to change it any time soon. Unless it comes built in with my operating system,
but even then I'll need to move my previous entries. On a second thought I can
keep the current entries where they are and open a blog on another url, eg.
blog.szabgab.com. In the longer run it would be probably better than trying to
add comments or trackback to the application as currently it does not accept 
any input from the web. I write my blog entries as 
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html">pod</a>
files and upload them via ssh.
