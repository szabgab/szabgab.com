=head1 How to find an open source project to contribute to?
=timestamp 1761629535
=tags Open Source

1. **One that you are enthusiastic about** e.g. because you use it. If it is an established, well known project then probably it will be difficult to contribute code to it as most of the simple things are already solved.

2. **A dependency of that project**. Most projects depend on 100s or even 1000s of 3rd party libraries. Many of those usually get a lot less attention so you will likely find easier things to do and you still help your favorite project.

3. **A semi-popular project that has been recently updated.** e.g. a project with 100-1000 starts that had a change in the last 4 weeks. Tweak these numbers to your liking. You probably don't want something that has no stars as that is probably not used by anyone. You don't want something with many stars as that is too "established" with few "easy" issues. You want something that is being maintained. You don't want to put in work and send a PR to a project that has not changed for a long time and thus it is likely your PR will not be handled either.

The [Advanced search on GitHub](https://github.com/search/advanced) allows you to set various parameters.

For example [this one](https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A100..1000+pushed%3A%3E2025-10-01+language%3APython+&type=repositories&ref=advsearch) limits the stars, sets the "last pushed date" and sets the programming language to Python.

Good luck!
