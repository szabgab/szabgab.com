I've just read the rant <a href="http://blog.urth.org/2009/05/dependencies-rule.html">Dependencies Rule</a>
by Dave Rolsky, his follow-up post
<a href="http://blog.urth.org/2009/05/the-real-problem-with-dependencies.html">The Real Problem With Dependencies</a>
and then <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/142/dependencies-dont-matter-but-stability-does/">Dependencies don't matter but stability does</a>
from David Golden.

I'd be really happy if the ideas expressed there started to get in shape and implemented.
Especially I'd be glad to have various stable snapshots of CPAN based on perl version or
operating system or both.

Anyway.

On one hand I usually recommend using CPAN modules instead of
writing your own code but probably every one of us has a limit
of minimum code avoided by using a dependency. Just to pick one
of my favorites, using [dist://File::Slurp] is probably plain 
bloat as writing that 4 lines of code that can read a file in 
slurp mode and putting it in a function is probably a lot cheaper 
than installing File::Slurp.

Of course File::Slurp has some other tools as well, e.g. write_file
so when you start implementing those you will start to feel sorry 
that you have not used File::Slurp in the first place. This is one of
the reasons people implement stuff on their own. First they only need
a small subset of what a module provides so they don't feel it justified
to include the whole apparently to them - bloated module. Then throughout
the life of the product they need to add more and more features that 
could be found in the other module so they expand their own implementation.
They usually can't switch to the CPAN module either because the API is different
or just for political reason. <i>What? Are you planning to throw away all that code
you wrote?</i>


If some of the deeper dependencies of my code already uses File::Slurp then
I (or the user) already has to pay the installation price so I could
just as well use that code. 

For that it would be nice to be able to check the list of 
all the dependencies of a CPAN module has every time I am planning
to use it.
<a href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Dependencies</a> is a nice
tool for that though I think it does not support optional dependencies
and it certainly won't support modules and applications not on CPAN. 
That would be a nice extension though to support DarkPAN.
