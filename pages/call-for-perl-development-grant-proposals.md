Alberto has recently published the official 
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2010/07/2010q3-call-for-grant-proposal.html">2010Q3 Call for Grant Proposals</a>
of <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>. I'd like to encourage everyone to submit proposals.
The dead-line is within 10 days.

The standard TPF development grants are limited up to 3,000 USD/grant.
I don't know the exact reason for that limitation but I am quite sure part of the 
reason is that TPF does not have a lot of money.

While this amount of money might not be a big motivation for someone who
lives in the wealthier areas of Europe or North America but as 
<a href="http://blog.urth.org/2010/07/do-tpf-grants-de-motivate.html">Dave Rolsky</a> 
and a number of others have pointed out getting the grant might have other positive effects.

On the other hand people living in countries where the salaries are much lower 
(e.g. India, China, Africa and even South America) could use such a grant and fill a full salary for
2-3 months or even longer. They could implement much bigger projects during that time period.

Let's see that there are lots of good proposals!
