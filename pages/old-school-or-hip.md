=tags Perl, Python, Tcl



For more than 10 years I focused mostly on Perl Training. I taught a few classes using Subversion.
In the early days I ran a course teaching Unix for power users, and even a PHP course, but soon I thought it would be
better to focus on one single technology.

This has been changing recently. Last month I taught my first Python class,
and currently I am preparing a Tcl course.

What? Python? Tcl?



Perl is considered old-school by many people, in a recent article, celebrating (?) the 25th birthday of Perl,
Bradley M. Kuhn  even compared <a href="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2012/12/18/perl-cobol.html">Perl to COBOL</a>.

I don't know what people thought about COBOL in 1984, so I don't know if the perception of the two languages
at their 25th birthday was similar, but I certainly see in my business that most of my clients learn Perl
either because they need to maintain an old code-base, or because they use Perl as a helper tool.

In both cases they inherited the use of Perl from an earlier generation in their company.

<h2>So what other languages should I teach?</h2>

I started teaching Python which feels to be new compared to Perl to many people, even though it is only 4 years younger,
and then I can start offering Ruby and maybe even more hip-languages and technologies. As I mentioned I took a
class building mobile web sites and mobile web applications.
I even started to build <a href="http://regexmaven.com/">Regex Maven</a>, my first mobile application. With some
investment I could teach HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript.

Or, I can focus on other "old-school" languages, such as Tcl, which happens to be the same age as Perl, and maybe even
teach COBOL.

Probably there need to be a mix. Finding out what companies actually need today and guessing which technologies they
will want to learn a few years from now.
