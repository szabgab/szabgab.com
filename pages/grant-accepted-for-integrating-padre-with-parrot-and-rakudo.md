Shortly before I finished writing about my <a href="/plans-for-the-next-month-or-two.html">Plans for the next month or two</a> I received the
news that my grant request for
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposal_perl_deb.html">
Perl debugger integration in Padre</a>
was postponed but the grant request to 
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposal_integrat.html">
Integrating Padre with Parrot and Rakudo</a> was 
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/12/2008q4_grants_results.html">accepted</a>.

So while I was quite disappointed that the Debugger grant was postponed I am glad 
at least one of my proposals got accepted and I'd like to thank the people in
<a href="http://vienna.pm.org/">Vienna.pm</a> as it turns out they 
are financing it and not TPF.

Actually I am quite surprised and disappointed that TPF did not have 
the money to finance the quarterly 10,000 USD of grants and that
AFAIK they did not say anything about this earlier.

While they have improved TPF still lacks enough transparency.
For example why is there no public mailing list with all the 
TPF officials subscribed where outsiders like me could 
initiate project publicly?

Anyway, I think TPF should start a fund raising drive similar to 
that of Wikipedia does. Of course they don't need 6,000,000 USD. 
They could aim at 100,000 USD. 
Wait, if they only raised 40,000 USD that would cover the regular grants 
for the next year. We have plenty of web real estate to promote the fund 
drive and I believe there are plenty of Perl users who would chip in with 
USD 10-20 or maybe even more. Or are we afraid that they 
are <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/38010">all</a> 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/38018">dead</a>?

TPF only needs to decide on it, setup the accounting,
write up the list of achievements from the previous grants
and create an image we can put on our web sites. 

I would be glad to put it on
<a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/">CPAN::Forum</a> and I am quite sure 
some of the bigger Perl related sites would be ready to do the same.

I would even volunteer to contact all the site maintainers 
personally and ask them to promote the fund drive.
