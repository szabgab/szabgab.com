A couple of days ago I asked <a href="http://csjewell.dreamwidth.org/">CSJewel</a>
for an invitation and opened an account on 
<a href="http://szabgab.dreamwidth.org/">DreamWidth</a>. I am still a bit lost as I
have no idea how to get connected to people and how to ask questions so that people
will actually see it and answer it, but people started to help me so I am making 
some progress.

I am not yet sure if it is a good idea or not but I created a community called
<a href="http://padre-the-perl-ide.dreamwidth.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE on Dreamwidth</a>
so DW users can discuss anything about Padre. The interesting thing is that the length of
the title was limited so I could not type in 
<i>Perl Application Development and Refactoring Environment</i>. Therefore I am using
a shorter title and I think I'll file a bug report.

If I was already into community accounts I went over to 
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> where I have 
<a href="http://szabgab.livejournal.com/">a dormant account</a>
and created a community for Padre there as well. Interestingly at LJ the length of
the community name was restricted to 15 characters so I could not use the same community
name as on DW. I had to go with 
<a href="http://padre-perl-ide.livejournal.com/">Padre, Perl IDE</a>. At least on LJ I could
type in the full title of the community.

Anyway, if you are a Dreamwidth or LiveJournal user, please drop by and say hi to me over there.
