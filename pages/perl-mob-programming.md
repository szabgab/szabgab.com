As an experiment <a href="https://domm.plix.at/">Thomas Klausner (domm)</a> and myself are going to host an online <b>Perl Mob programming</b> session.

<ul>
<li>Date: April 2 Thursday</li>
<li>Time: at 15:00 UTC (17:00 CET, 8 am PDT)</li>
<li>Duration: 2-4 hours.</li>
</ul>

It will run via <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> and we plan to use <a href="https://cyber-dojo.org/">Cyber Dojo</a>.

Cyber Dojo supports <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl 5</a>, though it does not support <a href="https://www.raku.org/">Raku</a>. Yet.
I have hopes that by that time the Raku developers will be able to send a Pull-Request to the maintainers of Cyber Dojo
or that we'll have an alternative that also supports Raku.

You can use Zoom in your browser, though I think it is a better experience if you download and install their client.

You will need a headphone and a camera in your computer is also recommended.

If you are interested to join, <a href="/contact.html">send me an e-mail</a>, and I'll send you an invitation.
