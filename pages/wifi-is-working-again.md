Once I understood that I really really must make sure my wifi works before
I arrive to <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2008/">YAPC::NA</a>
next week, I searched again. This time I had more luck
and found several references to 
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/178530">this</a> and 
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-backports-modules-2.6.24/+bug/185470/comments/65">this</a>.

In this end this is what I did:

   1. sudo modprobe -r iwl3945
   2. create a file named iwl3945 in /etc/modprobe.d
   3. in that file enter the following entries
   alias wmaster0 iwl3945
   options iwl3945 disable_hw_scan=1
   4. sudo modprobe iwl3945
   5. sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

That's it. Now my computer started to see the wireless networks around
and could connect.
