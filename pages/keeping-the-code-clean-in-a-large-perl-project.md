=head1 Keeping the code clean in a large Perl project

=tags Perl, tidy, Padre

In the Padre we have been using [dist://Perl::Tidy] to make sure the code
looks the same around the whole project. It is not perfect but we
felt that it is better to have a not perfect standard than to hope
that everyone will write in the same nice way.

We have project wise
<a href="http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/tools/perltidyrc">Perl::Tidy configuration file</a> and
<a href="http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/tools/tidy_project.pl">a script</a> in our
<a href="http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/tools/">tools directory</a>
that will go over all the files and tidy them.

In order to make it easy to separate real code changes from purely
layout changes we used to have perl tidy runs once in a while.
This of course generated big changes at those times and "svn blame"
is now less usable because of that.

So recently we
<a href="http://mail.perlide.org/pipermail/padre-dev/2011-February/002516.html">started to discuss</a>
the possibility to change the strategy and to run perltidy on every commit.

The assumption is that if everyone does this then every tidy will only effect the
code s/he just changed so it won't make it harder to see the actual change.
On the other hand it will eliminate the big tidy changes.

We even discussed the possibility to run automatic perltidy on the code
and check it in to the repository.

We don't yet have a final decision so I'd be interested to know
how other people handle this?

I assume in project where there is only one developer this is a non-issue.

How do larger projects handle it?
