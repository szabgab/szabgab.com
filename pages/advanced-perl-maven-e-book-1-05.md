I know it has been a while, I have all kinds of excuse for that, but finally it is here.
I have released the new edition of the Advanced Perl Maven e-book.



The new edition has several more slides about Moose. A new article about references. The other articles have also been
refreshed. There is also a new index at the end of the PDF file. Altogether the book grew from 134 to 171 pages.

If you have already purchased the book, you'll be able to download the new edition
<b>free of charge</b> after logging to <a href="http://perlmaven.com/account">your account</a>.

If you have not bought it yet, you can <a
href="http://perlmaven.com/advanced-perl-maven-e-book">buy it</a> after logging in to your
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/account">account</a>.
(Sorry for that, I know, I should make this easier.)
