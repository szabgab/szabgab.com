Some people asked how communities of other languages deal with the issues I raised in my 
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2010/06/hague-grant-application-perl-e.html">grant proposal</a>
Unfortunately it seems that some not all the comments submitted to that blog reach Karen for approval.

Specifically I have submitted this one already three times and she has not seen it yet. If you have submitted
any comment there, please check if it has appeared and if not, please post it somewhere else. Maybe
in your blot or as a response to this blog.

Now to the other languages:

As far as I can tell the <b>PHP</b> community does not have any Foundation 
(but it has Zend behind it). <b>Ruby</b> seem to have a hardly working 
<a href="http://www.ruby-assn.org/en/">Ruby Association</a>. 
Both of these languages are used by lots of small companies making money 
directly from the use of the language or platforms built on the language.

<b>Lua</b> has a 
<a href="http://www.lua.org/sponsors.html">corporate sponsorship program</a> 
but I don't see a lot of details about it. As far as I can tell it is mostly 
supported by the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. 
See <a href="http://www.lua.org/about.html">About Lua</a> for links.

<b>Python</b> have the 
<a href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>
that I analyzed in "<a href="/python-software-foundation.html">Python Software Foundation</a>" a bit a few weeks ago. As 
you can see Allison Randal is on the board of PSF and she is also on t
he board of TPF so maybe she can tell us a few words on how this works 
at the Python Foundation. There are also quite a number of small
companies using Python as part of their core business and as far 
as I know Google also directly supports it.

<b>Parrot</b> also has a 
<a href="http://www.parrot.org/foundation">Parrot Foundation</a>
with an
<a href="http://www.parrot.org/foundation/advisory_board">Advisory board</a>.

I don't see hundreds of individuals and small companies making money using 
<b>Perl</b>. There are a few but as far as I can tell it is mostly used in 
large companies and many people are using it as part of the toolset not as the
main tool.
