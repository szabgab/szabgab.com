While there are more and more web site with very little traffic, the number of medium-sized sites is growing rapidly.

Two years ago there were about 40-60,000 web sites with more than 100,000 monthly visits.
Today there 150,000 such web sites.

Peteris Krumins has been blogging for <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/six-years-of-blogging/">six years now</a>
and he is kind enough to share some data with us every year. According to the Google Analytics based graph on
<a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/six-years-of-blogging/">his report from July 24, 2013</a>,
there were about 90-100,000 monthly visits to <a href="http://catonmat.net/">catonmat.net</a>in the past few months.

If you look at the information <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> shows
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/catonmat.net">about Catonmat.net</a>,
you will see it currently has a global rank of 149,889 (It also fell 30,920 positions in the last 3 months.)

You will also see a graph showing the position of the site in the global ranking for the past 2 years.

As the graph changes every day, I copied here the one I saw on July 25 2013::

<img src="/img/alexa_catonmat_20130725.png" alt="Data of catonmat on Alexa" />

This shows that during the second half of 2011, catonmat.net was mostly between positions 40-60,000.

If you look at the report of Peteris Krumins on the 
<a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/five-years-of-blogging/">5th anniversary</a> of his site (July 14, 2012)
you can see that in the second half of 2011 there were about 120,000 monthly visits.
(except in December when he saw a sudden peak.)


So basically while the traffic of <a href="http://catonmat.net/">catonmat.net</a> was only slightly smaller,
(90K instead of 120K / month) its position fell from 40-60K to 150K.

Not only that, but according t Alexa, the web site lost 30K from its position in the last 3 months,
while the Google Analytics graph show almost no change in the last 6 months.
(The Alexa number is based on the "previous 3 months", so the number 3 month ago was based on traffic
in the first 3 months of 2013.

So the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long tail</a> is getting longer, but there
is also a <b>rapidly</b> growing number of sites with more than 100,000 visits/month.
