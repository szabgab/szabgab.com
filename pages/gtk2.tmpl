<h1>GTK2 Perl bindings</h1>

<p>
Recently I have started to use the <a href="http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/">Perl bindings of GTK2</a>
for several projects. As I felt I need some downloadable tutorial with some examples I started to build one.
Luckily there are many examples already in the source code and on various other pages so my task is
rather small.
