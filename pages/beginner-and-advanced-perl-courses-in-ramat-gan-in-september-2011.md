The last time I ran and Advanced Perl course there was a lot of interest so
I have just scheduled two new courses:

The <a href="http://pti.co.il/fundamentals.html">Fundamentals of Perl (Beginner)</a> course is 4 days long and will take place on 7,8,13,14 September 2011.
The <a href="http://pti.co.il/advanced.html">Advanced Perl course</a> is now 5 days long and will take place on 4,5,6,11,12 September 2011.

If you are interested participating in either of those classes please <a href="/contact.html">contact me directly</a>.
