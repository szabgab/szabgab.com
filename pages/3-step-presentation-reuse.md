It is fun to prepare a presentation, but if you can give the same, or more-or-less the same presentation several times to different audiences then you can gain more (experience, exposure, whatever) from the same investment, from the same preparations.

You can also improve the presentation between the events.

I am now the organizer of two programming language-groups in Israel, one focusing on Python and one focusing on Rust.

I am trying to offer the speakers 3 opportunities to give (more or less) the same presentation.

1. At one of our in-person meetings. Usually this will be given in Hebrew. Having live presentation face-to-face with the audience provides some high-bandwidth communication and feedback. (we don't record this).
1. At an online meeting in Hebrew. This will allow people who could not attend the in-person event to hear the presentation. After all going to an in-person meeting can be a huge investment in time. Especially for people living 1-2 hours from the center. We'll record this.
1. At an online meeting in English. This will allow people from all over the world to hear the presentation. We'll record this too.


## Length issues

At an in-person event we usually have 2-3 presentations of 15-45 minutes each and recently we started to have "lightning talks" as well. That is up to 5 minutes ad-hoc presentations. It usually lasts from 18:00-20:30. This includes time for mingling.
People probably won't want to stay more and having a short meeting with a single talk might make the commute to and from the venue feel not worth it.

With the online events there is no "commute expense", the attendees just sit in front of their computer and watch. They could even do it on their mobile device while on the bus home.
That means we can have much shorter events. Ideally each online event will have one presentation.

If there is only one presentation the speaker might take more time to go a bit deeper in some aspects of the subject. In addition we can have more time for QA, or we can have an additional conversation about the background of the speaker and how
he used the specific technology.
