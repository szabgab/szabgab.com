that led to a long
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/loas6/how_do_newbies_find_perl_learning_materials_online/">discussion on reddit</a>
with some misunderstanding and some good suggestions.

Let's do an exercise. Think about a subject you don't know much about,
eg. a programming language you have not used yet and start looking for ways to learn it.

Write down your path. Web sites, search terms etc. links you clicked. Invest 10-20 minutes in it.

If you have time invest a full hour in it.

Then publish all that either on your blog or as a comment to this blog.

We will be able to reflect based on that, how others might look
