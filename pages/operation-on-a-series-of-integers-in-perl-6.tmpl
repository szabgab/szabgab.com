I was a bit silent about it but I keep working on the
[dist://Perl6::Cookbook] 
Here is one of the entries from chapter 2.

Iterating over a series of integers in a range is similar in Perl 6
to the same code in Perl 5 except of slightly different format of the
foreach loop that is spelled only as <b>for</b> now.

 my $x = 23;
 my $z = 25;

 for $x .. $z -> $i {
     say $i;
 }

Will print the numbers 23, 24, 25 as expected.

C-style, 3-part for loops are also available in Perl 6 and they are
called <b>loop</b> but they are not really recommended.
Better to use the for loop as described above.
You could say this, but it has the same issues with off-by-one errors
as we have already learned to avoid in Perl 5.

 loop (my $i = $x; $i <= $z; $i++) { 
     say $i;
 }

Iterating over every 2nd number is also possible with the for loop
of Perl 6 using the <b>by</b> adverb.

for $x .. $y :by(2) -> $i {
	say $i;
}

Obviously you could use it to jump any, even negative numbers.

Unfortunately as I am writing this, the above code using
the <b>by</b> adverb does not yet work in Rakudo.
