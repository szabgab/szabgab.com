=head1 Linux Tag Berlin 2011, late call for talks
=timestamp 1296827925
=tags Perl, PEG, Berlin

Sorry for the late post. <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">Linux Tag Berlin</a> will take
place between 11-14 May, 2011 in, well, Berlin, Germany. The late dead-line of the call for papers is 8 February.

Last year we had a Perl booth and I managed to get two ad-hoc slots to give talks.
One about Perl 6 and the other about Testing in Open Source projects.

It would be nice if this year there were several Perl related talks in the schedule
so more people would show up at these talks.
The <a href="http://wiki.linuxtag.org/w/vp:Call_for_Papers">CFP</a> 
can be found linked from <a href="http://wiki.linuxtag.org/w/vp:Main_Page">wiki of LinuxTag</a>.

We will also try to get space for the Perl booth again and it would be nice to see other Perl
based projects to join us.

If needed, the <a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a> might be able
to help covering the travel costs for 1-2 speakers.
