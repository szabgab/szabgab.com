While we have already seen the release of 0.46 to CPAN
<a href="http://csjewell.dreamwidth.org/">Curtis Jewell</a> 
has released the first version of
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre Standalone for Windows</a>.

It contains Padre 0.45 and is built on a recent version of
Strawberry Perl for Windows
Once installed you can easily upgrade Padre to 0.46
directly from CPAN. 
(See the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/howto.html">Howto</a> page)


The objective of Padre Standalone for Windows is to provide
an easily installable and easily upgradeable editor for people
who already have perl installed or who are using perl on a
remote machine (opening and saving files via ftp or ssh)
or for people who use it for editing other languages.

While it will contain a full Strawberry Perl installation, it will
happily live together with any other Perl installation
(e.g. any version of ActivePerl ) and the users won't even
need to know it is running on Perl. Actually it will probably
require a separate perl installation if you really want to run
perl code.


We are still a couple of months away from having all the
features but we have started to build a 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Distribution#PadreStandalone">wiki page outlining</a>
the plans and the feature we would like to include.


If you would like to help, you can look around our 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/">bug tracking system</a> 
and/or you can 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/getting_involved.html">get involved</a> 
in other ways.
