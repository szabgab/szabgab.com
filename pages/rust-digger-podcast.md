=abstract start

In Spetember I was interviews for [The Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/).
Apparently there was a bit of a queue processing the recorded episodes and thus mine was published in November, two months after its recording.

It was right on time for my birthday, but unfortunately I did not make a lot of progress on the [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/)
project since the recording. Also I have not seen any reactions. This was rather disappointing.

In any case here is the link to the episode of [Rust Digger with Gabor Szabo](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/gabor-szabo/) on The Rustacean Station Podcast.
