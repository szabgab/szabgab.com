=tags Perl, Perl Maven

=abstract start

With September the new school-year has started which gave me more time to write articles and to record screencasts.
This extra free time (to work :), show in much better productivitiy. Albeit I am still frustrated on days when
I feel I did not make enough progress.

As I can see I published 18 new Perl Maven posts and managed to some other stuff.

<h2>EduMaven</h2>

I kept publishing pages on the <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/">EduMaven</a> site albeit at a much slower rate. By now there are
399 <a href="https://code-maven.com/perl-programming">Programming Perl pages</a>,
389 <a href="https://code-maven.com/python-programming">Programming Python pages</a>,
324 <a href="https://code-maven.com/test-automation-using-perl">Test Automation Using Perl</a> pages,
and a bunch of other slides. A total of 1390 pages.

<h2>Perl Weekly</h2>

Nothing special happened. The the weekly growth rate of the subscribers is les than 10.

<h2>Padre, the Perl IDE</h2>

It wasn't my doing, but the source code repository of <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/kaare/2014/09/padre-is-now-on-github.html">Padre has moved to GitHub</a>.
This is awesome. I used the opportunity to factor out some code into a separate module, and some other people have also started to do stuff.
This might provide an opportunity to restart development.

Once thing I have been planning for a while alrady was moving many of the wiki pages to be part of the
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">real Padre site</a> where they belong.
I've started to do that but got frustrated by the manual process. Became the maintainer of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Text-Trac">Text::Trac</a>, but did not have time to improve it to be able to conevrt the
pages automatically. I found a few other, more interesting projects.

<h2>Code::Maven</h2>

I long time ago I started a project called CPAN::Digger, that was supposed to analyze the source code of all the CPAN modules and even Perl code that is not
on CPAN. Later I started another project called PyDigger, written in Python, that had the same purpose, but to analyzes Python source code. Both were stopped
due to lack of time.

This time I hope it will be different. The goal is also different.
The <a href="http://code-maven.com/">Code::Maven</a> site was launched on 16th September, and the few days
after it I spent improving it a lot, but have not got to the real interesting part yet. Then I got distracted. Specifically I got fed-up that
I have to brew perl on every server I use and decided to restart building <a href="http://dwimperl.szabgab.com/">DWIM Perl for Linux</a>.
Now that DWIM Perl is quite ready I should go back to working on the Code::Maven project.

<h2>DWIM Perl for Linux</h2>

I spent almost a week building <a href="http://dwimperl.szabgab.com/">DWIM Perl for Linux</a>. So far I've release 9 revision of it with a growing
number of modules and the 10th should be ready soon. The project went quite well, but I am a quite frustrated as the feedback was really minimal.
I think I've heard only from 3 or 4 people who have tried it or liked the idea. Even though I wrote about it on
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/09/dwim-perl-for-linux---version-52019-released.html">blogs.perl.org</a>,
got it onto <a href="http://perlnews.org/2014/09/dwim-perl-for-linux-5-20-1-2-released/">Perl News</a>, and posted on
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/2hfkbu/dwim_perl_for_linux_perl_5201/">Reddit</a> too.

I know I should show it in use more, but first I need to make sure I can use it on all of my servers.

<h2>Open Source</h2>

I kept patching <a href="http://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a>. It is fun. I learn quite a few things, and once my pull-requests are accepted
this can have an immediate impact to the 160,000 people visiting the MetaCPAN site every month. As I think people need to be
introduced to the <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/09/somenew-metacpan-features.html">new features of MetaCPAN</a>
I even wrote about it. Oh and I became <a href="https://metacpan.org/about/contributors">one of the top contributors of MetaCPAN</a>.

In <a href="/perl-maven-august-2014.html">August</a> I started to send pull-requests to CPAN authors who did not have
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/08/link-to-public-version-control-system-github-or-otherwise.html">link to VCS</a>.
At the beginning of the month I kept doing it, but after a while I got tired of this. I think there are still a few pull-requests
I sent that are waiting for people to integrate.
