This is the belated report for May 2021 (See also the [list of previous reports](/reports).

## Overview

Given that I am writing this report on June 11th the various subscriber numbers of this report and of the next report won't
really reflect a month. Luckily (not a very good luck though) they probably don't change much these days.

On May 15 I started to learn the [Crystal programming language](https://crystal-lang.org/),
started to prepare slides as a way of learning and started to work on a project collecting data about shards,
the Crystal language packages.

A week later, once I had a skeleton of the project, I submitted a talk-proposal to the Crystal conference and
then spent a huge amount of time working on the project. About 4 weeks after starting it I found out that
there is already a site doing most of the things I planned to do. (But that's the story for June already...)

One of the reasons that I am so late writing this post is that I
enjoyed so much writing that application in Crystal that I wanted to spend all my time on it.

We went to the funeral of the father of close friend and later we went to the Shiva. Both was impressive.
These people know how to talk and it was clear they loved him very much.

I posted on LinkedIn that I have spare time for a new client. I got surprisingly many likes and shares on my post
and 7 leads. I already signed with one of them and I hope to sign with another client soon.

The first one is fully remote the second one will probably want me to come on-site. At least some of the days.
We'll see.

## Webinars and Meetups

This month I had only one <a href="https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/">webinar in Hebrew</a>.
See the hikes for my other Meetup group.

## Live Pair programming

I had quite a few live pair programming events. We are making progress in 2 applications and we had some
separate items as well
Check out the <a href="https://code-maven.com/live">live pair programming events</a> page where I list all the previous
episodes and all the planned events.

In general very few people attend the events while we are coding, but there are a few 10s sometimes a few 100s who watch
the video later on.

In any case the main goal is to make progress in the applications and to learn new things.

## Spanish lessons

Keep using <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>.

In May I think I did not have [Spanish](/spanish) lessons via <a href="https://code-maven.com/italki">italki</a>.

## COVID 19

It is effectively over here in Israel. Very few restrictions remain, but traveling abroad is still not easy.

## Games

Playing lots of games on <a href="https://www.dragongoserver.net/">Dragon Go Server</a>
and also on <a href="https://online-go.com/">Online Go</a>.


## Sport

According to <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> I went walking 12 times in May.

## Other

I submitted the grades for all the students in the <b>Programming Bootcamp</b>. Yeah!

## TODO

Less than 3 weeks are left from this month.

My talk proposal was accepted to the Crystal conference so I will want to continue learning Crystal. Maybe instead of
working my own project I'll work only on my Crystal slides and I will try to contribute to other projects.

I plan to continue doing a lot of pair-programming or [team-programming](/team-programming)  <a href="https://code-maven.com/live">live</a>.

I have some work to do with my paying clients.
