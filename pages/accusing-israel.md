For 2000 years the Jews were blamed, using "ample evidence", for killing Jesus, poisoning wells, killing Christians children for their blood, spreading the plague, etc.

All turned out to be false.

Now the Jewish state is blamed, again with "ample evidence" as before, for apartheid, ethnic cleansing, stealing land etc.



What are the odds that finally, after so many false claims, these are actually true?

Can the current blaming have the same false roots?

Wouldn't the former make you question the new accusations?
