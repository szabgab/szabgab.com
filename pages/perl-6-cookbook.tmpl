In my <a href="/new-years-resolutions-2009.html">New Year's Resolutions</a> I decided to prepare a one day training class for Perl 6.
Part of the plan will be to implement the relevant parts of the 414 recipes found
in the 2nd edition of the <a href="http://books.perl.org/book/203">Perl 5 Cookbook</a>
by Nathan Torkington and Tom Christiansen.

I know there was an effort in the 
Pugs repository
to do so along the
<a href="http://pleac.sourceforge.net/">PLEAC - Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook</a>
project but I think it will be fun to try to write all the examples 
by myself reading again the Perl 5 Cookbook and trying to write everything using
[dist://Padre::Plugin::Perl6] and running over the latest version of 
<a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a>.

In general I plan to write one recipe a day but I am sure some of 
them will be either trivial or irrelevant for Perl 6. Others might not yet be
available in the Rakudo implementation of Perl 6.

Part of the real cookbook can be read online on 
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hP4IRp8xwTkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=perl+cookbook&ei=uO9dSeP1LoLeyASd8ojvDg">Google books</a>

The one I am writing is distributed on CPAN:
[dist://Perl6::Cookbook]
