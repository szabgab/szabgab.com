(Based on the Level 8 game, but played with 2 packs of regular French cards)

We have 2*52 cards. 2 * 4 shapes * 13 (2-10JQKA) cards.
The 4 shapes are diamonds (♦), clubs (♣), hearts (♥) and spades (♠)
Optionally we can include the 2*2 Jokers.

Shuffle the cards and deal 10 to each player.
Put the rest of the cards in a pack face down in the middle.
Take the top most card and put it on your side of the pack face up.

On each turn the current player will throw away one card putting it on their side of the pack with face up.
That means that the number of cards we can see face up can be any number up to the total number of players.

On each turn the player needs to pick up a card. She can pick one of the cards that were thrown away earlier and they now face up, or shick can pick the top most cart from the pack.
At the end of her round she will need to throw away one card putting it in front of her (next to the pack).

The objective is to collect enough cards to be able to put down the requirements of the current level.
Once that's done you mark the level that you have finished it. From that point on till the end of the game you can put the cards remainig in your hand and add them to cards that were already place on the table as part of the fullfillment of any of the players.
If all the cards of a player found their place, the game is over. The winning person can mark the smallest of the levels as "done".
