I am happy to announce the release of version 0.48 of 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>

Padre is written in Perl and it aimed to be the best editor
for writing Perl scripts and applications. Both in Perl 5 
and in Perl 6.

=abstract end

Thanks to the many contributors, in the recent versions it 
gained a very good help system for both major versions of 
Perl.

Padre has a plug-in system that allows easy extension of the 
application with just a few lines of Perl code.

This release was started by Ryan Niebur who made the previous 
two releases but he became busy and asked us to finish the
release and replace him from now on. I jumped in and finished
the release process and I'd like to take this opportunity to
thank for Ryan the work he has done so far!

I'd also like to thank to the many contributors of Padre who 
made it possible. As you can see from the 
<a href="http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Padre/Changes">changes file</a>
most of the changes in this release were made by Sebastian Willing (SEWI)
and Ahmad M. Zawawi (AZAWAWI) with a few other changes by 
Adam Kennedy (ADAMK), Olivier Mengu√© (DOLMEN), 
Peter Lavender (PLAVEN, waxhead), myself (SZABGAB) and probably 
a few others who have forgotten to add themselves to the changes file.


<h2>Availability</h2>
