I've been <a href="/spanish.html">learning Spanish</a> for a year now.

A natural next step might be to also learn Ladino, the language spoken by Jews of the Iberian peninsula before they were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain">expelled</a> that lived on in the various
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sefardic</a> communities around the world.

This is a (small) collection of resources.
