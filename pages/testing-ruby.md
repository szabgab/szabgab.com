This is part of a series of articles I started with <a href="/quality-assurance-and-automated-testing-in-open-source-software.html">Quality Assurance and Automated Testing in Open Source Software</a>.

<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> is a relatively young dynamic language
that got a serious boost in the recent years thanks to the 
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> framework for building web application.

<h2>Development</h2>

Development and patching is described on the 
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/ruby-core/">Ruby Core</a> page.

Version control: Subversion

Building Ruby from the trunk requires an already working version of Ruby.

The commands to build Ruby are easy:

    svn co http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk ruby
    cd ruby
    autoconf
    ./configure
    make
    make test
    
    PASS 729 tests

Actually one can run either <b>make test</b> that will run a smaller set of tests
(currently 729 unit tests) or <b>make check</b> that will run a larger set of test
but what has crashed last time when I tried with <b>Segmentation fault</b>.

<h2>Testing</h2>

In the test suit of Ruby they employ 
the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> Ruby class.
This class provides a set of assertions for the unit tests such as <i>assert(trueness)</i>,
<i>assert_equal(expected_value, received_value)</i>, etc...

Tests can be found in the <a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk/test/">test/</a>
subdirectory of the source code.

<h2>Automated Testing</h2>

I asked on the 
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/#ruby-core">Ruby-Core</a>
development mailing list and according to the response there is not automated smoke
testing in Ruby.

On the other hand the <a href="http://www.rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> project aimed 
at creating a virtual machine for Ruby has its own separate set of test creating the
specifications.
