=timestamp 1266144839
=tags Perl, Israel, Rehovot

This is a slightly late announcement of the upcoming meeting of the Rehovot Perl Mongers.
On Tuesday 16th February, we are going to hear a presentation of <a href="http://pg-consultants.com/">Peter Gordon</a>:
Asynchronous IO with Perl including an introduction to non-blocking sockets and [dist://IO::Lambda]


Details of the meeting and directions can be found on the home page of the <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/meetings.html">Rehovot Perl Mongers</a>.

Unfortunately I'll be quite late to the meeting if I can come at all as I am teaching Perl in Jerusalem till 17:30 but I still hope
to be able to send the standard bourekas and croissant shipment.

Please RSVP to <a href="/contact.html">me</a>
