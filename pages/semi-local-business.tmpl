A while ago I wrote that I was thinking <a href="/contract-is-finished-life-is-beautiful.html">how to change my business</a>.
Since then I have been reading lots of blogs on what to do, and how to do. On of them is
called <a href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/">Firepole Marketing</a>.

I have mixed feelings about that site. It is a bit flashy and a bit too "marketingish" for
me but I think there is some substance in what they are talking about.

The funny thing is that one of the owners, <a href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/blog/danny-iny/">Danny Iny</a>,
lived in Israel for a few years
while the other one, <a href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/blog/peter-vogopoulos/">Peter Vogopoulos</a>,
was actually a Unix sysadmin and has been using Perl in his previous life. Interesting overlaps with my life.

The fact that Peter changed his sysadmin job to be a self-employed entrepreneur,
running an on-line business means that maybe I too, can learn from them how
to improve my small business. In other words, how to get paid for my work.

One of the ideas I mentioned was <a href="/perl-training-materials-or-even-books.html">reusing my Perl training materials</a>
and making some money from that. From that idea I reached the conclusion that
I'll need to split up my blog. Leave all the meta writings here in my personal
blog and move all the Perl-related content to a separate site.
That will focus on <b>helping people using Perl</b>.

I am working on it and will let you know once I have something to show but it takes
more time than I expected.

In any case, the aim is to take my "business" (which is just a fancy word for
contract work and training) that was mostly local, and turn it into
more of a on-line and international thing. The on-line part will be that site
I mentioned but you can think of the
<a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly Newsletter</a> as part of the story.

Even though, I set it up without thinking at all of its "business value".

The international part will be more <a href="/training.html">Perl training courses</a> offered overseas.
Mostly in Europe and North America. I already gave a few
<a href="/training.html">Perl training classes</a> in some cities but those wore mostly by luck
and by the kindness of the local organizers.

I need to find a way to ensure a regular flow of training classes in those places.

The <a href="/perl-testing-training-class-at-the-london-perl-workshop.html">Perl Testing training class at the London Perl Workshop</a> is a small step in that direction.

Anyway, the guys at Firepole Marketing are running a survey to try to understand
how such moves worked for other people. They call it the
<a href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/blog/survey/">Semi-Local Business Survey</a>
indicating that part of the income is from local customers and part from, well, non-local ones.

If you are running such business or thinking about it (e.g Perl consulting? Perl contract work?
Web-site development?) you might want to head over and fill that survey. It takes about 10 minutes.

Including a 5 minute tea break.
