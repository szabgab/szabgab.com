=head1 CFP: Perl at SCALE 9x in Los Angeles
=timestamp 1291747470
=tags Perl, SCALE, Los Angeles, PEG, conference, talks

SCALE is one of the largest Open Source related events on the West Coast. According to what I read there are 
about 1500 visitors, lots of talks and an expo part where projects and companies can have their booth. 
This time it will take place between 25-27 February 2011.

The <a href="http://losangeles.pm.org/">Los Angeles Perl Mongers</a> had a booth in the previous years. 
This year I am also trying to get involved in the organization and making sure that there are several Perl related
talks at the conference.

We just got the confirmation from the organizers that we can have a Perl Mongers booth there. We will need people to
(wo)man that booth during the conference.

I think it would be also important to have a number of Perl related talks. The idea is to present both improvements 
in Perl and CPAN the happened in the last few years but also to show solutions to problems unrelated to Perl.
Think about the audience who might want to have a blog engine, a content management system or a data analysis tool.
What solution could they get which is based on Perl?

The dead-line for submitting papers is on 13th December, less than a week away. Please see the official
<a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale9x/blog/scale-9x-call-papers">call for papers</a> and submit 
your talk proposal now.

I have created a page on the TPF Events site for <a href="https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/index.cgi?events_2011_scale9x">SCALE 9x</a>.
We can use that to prepare the Perl presence at SCALE. Further discussion will take place on the 
<a href="https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/index.cgi?events">TPF events mailing list</a> and on the mailing list of
<a href="http://losangeles.pm.org/">Los Angeles Perl Mongers</a>

I am almost sure that I am also going to attend the event so I can introduce the 
<a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a>. In order to make that really useful I'll have to
setup several meetings with managers at companies as I believe personal contact makes a lot of difference.
