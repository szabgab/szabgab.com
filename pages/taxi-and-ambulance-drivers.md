=head1 Taxi Drivers - Ambulances - Women

Uber offered a really great opportunity to meet interesting people otherwise I'd probably never meet.
I recall a few years ago while we were in the USA with my family we used Uber for several rides and every
time our driver was a very interesting personality. With each one of them we had very interesting conversations.

Today I had a similar experience in Hungary. The my driver had a totally regular taxi
she also had an ambulance jacket on her seat.



As a COVID pre-caution I was sitting at the back and wearing a mask (even though it is currently not required in Hungary)
and asked her about her story.

I know there aren't that many women who drive a taxi, but I was really surprised to hear
that only a few years ago were women allowed to drive Ambulance cars or even be in Ambulances.

And I know that they are not just drivers, I think they are also trained paramedics and do everything there is to do during
an emergency call.

She told me that she has been driving Ambulances for more than a year now which is the joy and driving Taxis that makes the money.
She told me all kind of other interesting things about her life that were fascinating, but I won't repeat them here. The point is
that every time I take a taxi through the grapevine of my mothers Taxi-driver connection, the driver is an interesting person.

Once it as a race-car driver. Another time a bass-guitar player.


Anyway, back to the ambulances. I search a little bit and found a few articles, for example this one:
<a href="https://magyarnemzet.hu/belfold/a-mentoknel-nincsenek-kiralylanyok-7267400/">No princesses at the ambulances (Hungarian)</a>
It has a few slightly sexist remarks, but I learned from it that Gábor Csató, the CEO of the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orsz%C3%A1gos_Ment%C5%91szolg%C3%A1lat">National Ambulance Service (Hungarian)</a>
in 2017 introduced in the possibly for women to serve on the ambulances and to become drivers of ambulance cars.

Another link to the <a href="https://www.mentoalapitvany.hu/">Ambulance foundation (Hungarian)</a>

Women are still a small minority among the ambulance personel in Hungary, but their numbers are growing.

On the other hand we know that the nurses in hospitals are primarily women.

I wonder how is this in other countries? Are women barred from working on ambulances or driving ambulances?
What is the ratio of women and men on ambulances.
