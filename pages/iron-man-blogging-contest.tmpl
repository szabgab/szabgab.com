After 2 days of Perl Workshop and 3 days of Hackathon
I am still in Oslo, giving my Test Automation training 
which does not leave me with enough energy to write blog posts
with real content.

So I just link to the announcement of Matt Trout titled 
<a href="http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/iron-man/">We Are Iron Man</a>.
Those who know Matt can already expect the style of the language so you won't be
surprised, to anyone else, don't read that post if you are easily offended
by harsh language.

I am really unsure if there is any added value to that style of language. 
I am quite sure he is not using it when talking to customers so I wonder
if it is good to use it in a blog post that is about public relations...

Anyway I think the idea is good. I am looking forward to see how many people
out there are blogging about Perl related subjects and who will link to who?
