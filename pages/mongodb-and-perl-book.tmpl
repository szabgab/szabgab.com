<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> is probably the most popular open-source NoSQL database,
but there is no book on how to use it with the Perl Programming language.

As I have been using MongoDB for a project recently, I started to like it very much.
It makes development so much easier than a traditional SQL database.

So I started to write a book on using MongoDB with Perl.

The book will be available in electronic format via the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site
along with the other <a href="http://perlmaven.com/products">Perl books</a>.

The book is written in the form of a series of articles published on
the Perl Maven site.

Subscribers of the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/pro">Perl Maven Pro</a> already
have access to the HTML version of the
early <a href="http://perlmaven.com/mongodb">MongoDB with Perl</a> articles.

Of course, Pro subscribers also have access to <a href="http://perlmaven.com/archive?tag=pro">many more articles</a>.
