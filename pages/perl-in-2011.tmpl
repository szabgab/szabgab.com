There were a number of very good posts about Perl in 2010. 
Dan Wright wrote about the <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2011/01/tpf-programs-in-2010.html">activities of The Perl Foundation</a> 
in 2010.
Garu, from the Onion Stand wrote about <a href="http://onionstand.blogspot.com/2010/12/2010-filled-with-perls.html">2010 filled with Perl</a>.
chromatic added <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/12/the-best-of-perl-2010.html">The Best of Perl 2010</a>.

Moritz Lenz had his own entry about <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/perl-6-in-2010.html">Perl 6 in 2010</a>
and Renee Baecker wrote about <a href=""http://reneeb-perlblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/mein-perl-jahr-2010.html>his year in Perl</a> (in German).

Karen Pauley, the president of The Perl Foundation wrote about <a href="http://martian.org/karen/2011/01/01/perl-2010/">Perl 2010</a>.

There were at least two Japanese blog entries as well. One on the <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/gfx/20101231/1293796136">Islands in the byte stream</a>
and the other one by <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/tokuhirom/20101231/1293781276">tokuhirom</a>.

so let me focus on the future.

<h1>What is going to happen in 2011?</h1>

There are going to be the general things Rakudo and Perl 6 making further progress. Moose and the whole <b>Modern Perl</b> idea gaining 
further momentum. 

<h2>January</h2>

The <a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a> will run a survey based 
on the <a href="http://survey.perlfoundation.org/">TPF survey</a> from 2010 
enhancing it in several ways. Soon I'll write about it more.

Between 14-16 the <a href="http://www.perloasis.info/opw2011/">Perl Oasis</a> will take place in Orlando, Florida.
There is going to be a full-day <a href="http://www.perloasis.info/opw2011/schedule?day=2011-01-14">Moose training</a> on Friday. 
Three tracks of talks on <a href="http://www.perloasis.info/opw2011/schedule?day=2011-01-15">Saturday</a>
and a hackathon on <a href="http://www.perloasis.info/opw2011/schedule?day=2011-01-16">Sunday</a>
There are a number of talks I'd really like to see. I hope they will be offered at YAPC::NA as well.

Between 18-19 the <a href="http://www.plat-forms.org/">Plat Forms</a> contest will take place in NÃ¼rnberg in Germany. 
There are 3 Perl teams among the <a href="http://www.plat-forms.org/teams-2011">16 teams</a>. I wish the teams good luck.
