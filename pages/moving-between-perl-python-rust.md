Recently there was a potential work for a client in California helping their team to move from **Perl** to **Rust**.
It seems that work fell through, but it reminded me that I should probably seek similar opportunities where companies want to move between these 3 languages: 🐪 **Perl**, 🐍 **Python**, and 🦀 **Rust**.

Given that I know all 3 languages rather well, I am sure I can assist them better than someone who knows only the target language.

We can have a planning session to see what are their needs in order to make the move and we can evaluate the feasibility of that move.
I can provide the training, I can help them write the code, set up testing and the appropriate Continuous Integration environment.

In a nutshell 🌰 🐚 I can shorten the time it takes for their employees to get productive in the target language and I can help shorten the time they spend on the move to the other language.
I can help them save 💰 money.
