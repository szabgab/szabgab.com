<h2>Overview</h2>

I was busy and I have been neglecting my monthly reports so this is a bi-monthly report.

In the last two month I spent an enormous time on the <b>Advanced Python</b> course I was teaching at the <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/">Weizmann Institute of Science</a>.
I had to prepare lots of material for the course that I thought the first time. I hope the students were satisfied. For next year, if we run the course again, I'll have to work even
more to improve the course. Not only that I spent a lot of time on it, I also spent a lot of time agonizing that I should work on it and that stopped me from
doing a lot of other things. This was not a good feeling.

I also spent a lot of time and energy on Twitter writing about Zionism, Anti-Zionism, and Anti-Semitism in general.

I managed to read a few books these months, so not all the time went to the advanced course.

</ul>

I am currently reading

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C58ZP5D/">Uprooted: How 3000 Years of Jewish Civilization in the Arab World Vanished Overnight</a> by Lyn Julius</li>

</ul>

Oh yes and I started to learn <a href="/ladino.html">Ladino</a> and started to contribute to an open source project called <a href="https://librelingo.app/">LibreLingo</a>. A lot of time went there too.

<h2>Personal blog posts</h2>

8 posts on my <a href="https://szabgab.com/blog.html">personal site</a> not that bad.

<h2>LinkedIn</h2>

Number of followers:

  Hebrew:   623 (-)
  English:  557 (-)
  Spanish:   47 (-)
  Hungarian: 11 (-)

  Perl:    804 (+1)
  Python:  749 (+14)
  DevOps:  365 (+2)
  Golang:  213 (+1)

  Personal: 4,276 (+15)

I hardly had any activity, but I helped my son to spread his posts a bit. That got quite some attention.

<h2>Twitter</h2>

I started following even more people in the Jewish/Zionist circles. Tried to contribute with likes, re-shares and occasional posts.
I don't how much value is there in this. It is clear that I lost a number of my follower who apparently don't like to hear about these topics.

On the other hand the Twitter account of the Perl Weekly saw a slight increase in the number of followers even though I have not posted there anything.
Maybe that's the secret.

I primarily posted in my two <a href="/twitter.html">main Twitter accounts</a>.

Number of followers:

  szabgab:      2,419 (-11)
  PerlWeekly:   2,796 (+8)
  PerlMaven:      581 (-)
  Code__Maven:     22 (-)

Frankly, I don't know if there is really any use in participating in Twitter, I guess I'll have to ponder about this in a separate post.

<h2>Perl Maven</h2>

On the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site there were 7 posts in November-December.

You can see them in the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/archive">archive</a>.

<h2>Code Maven</h2>

On the <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> site there were no posts in November-December.

You can see them in the <a href="https://code-maven.com/archive">archive</a> there.

<h2>Perl Weekly</h2>

In November-December I edited 4 out of the 9 issues of the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> newsletter.

<h2>YouTube</h2>

The number of followers on the various <a href="/youtube.html">YouTube channels</a>:

  English:   2,390 (+40)
  Hebrew:      231 (+8)
  Spanish:      17 (-)
  Hungarian:    12 (-)

Funny they are growing even tough I only posted one or two videos.

<h2>Webinars and Meetups</h2>

In these 2 months I had no <a href="https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/">webinar</a>.

<h2>Live Pair programming</h2>

I had no events

These days I do a lot of pair programming with my clients so I have a lot less energy for doing public pair-programming sessions.

<h2>Spanish lessons</h2>

I only had a few lessons via Italki. I tried to have a few new conversation partners, but 2 of them were quite failures. Their Internet connection
was really bad and somehow we could hardly find anything common to talk about. They were both new to italki, so maybe they will improve,
but it did not give me a lot of good feelings. This was the first time I did not give people 5 stars.

Italki sent me a report that I had 48 lessons by 16 different teachers.

<h2>French lessons</h2>

I stopped it. I don't have enough motivation for this.

<h2>Ladino lessons</h2>

I started to invest a lot of time and energy in <a href="/ladino.html">Ladino</a> aka. Judeo-Spanish. I started to watch courses on YouTube.
I bought a book teaching it and a dictionary. I started to write a course for <a href="https://librelingo.app/">LibreLingo</a>.
(I also invested a few days of work creating tools for language editors of LibreLingo. There aren't many so it is primarily for myself now,
but I hope that more people will pick up the project and start creating courses. Even if not, these tools will be useful for me and for others
who might help me.)

I talked about Ladino and I got in contact with several central figures of the Ladino-speaking community. I still have a long way to go
to actually start to speak, but I hope this investment will pay off.

<h2>Games</h2>

Still playing lots of games on <a href="https://www.dragongoserver.net/">Dragon Go Server</a>.

<h2>Sport</h2>

According to <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> I went walking 12 times in November and 9 times in December.
I had a feeling that I am not doing enough sport. I think partially it is due to being winter and getting dark and coldish too soon
in the afternoon.

<h2>Hiking</h2>

If you are interested in the routes and the pictures here are the hikes I did in November-December:

<h2>TODO - New Year's resolution for 2022</h2>

I think I already wrote that I don't like New Year's resolutions. I noticed I change directions much more frequently than a year
and like most people I'd abandon my New Year's resolution very soon.
That's part of the reason I have this (almost) <a href="/reports.html">monthly reporting</a>.

Nevertheless I do have some plans or at least hopes.

I hope that I'll be able to get the support from the real experts of <a href="/ladino.html">Ladino</a> to continue learning the language and to continue developing
tools for people to learn the language. I also hope to be able to spend time speaking with many Ladino speakers around the world and to encourage other
people to increase the communication among fellow members of the tribe.

Along the way I hope that the tools I help develop will be useful for other endangered languages as well.

While learning and practicing Ladino I will want to continue with the Modern Spanish as well to make sure I can separate the two.

Income-wise I hope I'll have clients throughout the year to the tune of 100 hours a month. That will allow me to earn enough money and to
invest large amounts of my time in my hobbies which is writing articles about programming, teaching programming and the stuff around it,
contributing to various open source projects, learning Spanish and Ladino and hiking.

I hope I'll be able to for even more hikes than in 2021 and to keep doing the sport I did.

International travel will depend a lot on the COVID situation that does not look very promising for 2022.
So my hope is primarily that I'll be able to visit my mother a few times.

<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
