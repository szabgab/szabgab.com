Ladino, aka. Judeo-Spanish or Djudeo-Espanyol is the language spoken by descendats of the Jews who were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain">expelled</a> from the Iberian peninsula in 1492.

It was the language of the various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sefardic</a> communities around the world.

Today there are very few people for whom it is a mother-tongue, but there are many people around the world working on keeping the
language alive.



I started to collect <a href="https://ladino.szabgab.com/">resources about Ladino</a> on another page.
