In this longish post I am trying to enumerate all the forces that care about Perl. 
Both those who are <b>"just" having fun</b> and those who are <b>in for the money</b>.



Many people might react badly if I claim that they have financial interest
in the well being of Perl as they see it only as fun. My feeling is that the
"Perl community" - whatever that would be - does not like the idea of making
money using Perl. So when I am at a YAPC I am expected to wear of my 
<b>We do it for the fun</b> hat only.

On the other hand when I am around people who do not care about Perl or do 
not use it, I have to explain them in other terms why do I spend so much time in 
writing open source Perl code and trying to promote the language.
Fun is strange but sort of acceptable for them but when I tell them about 
<b>my financial interest in it well being of Perl and the ecosystem around it</b>
then they understand and accept it.

I have started to write this blog entry a while ago as part of my plan
to add a more business oriented face to the many faces of Perl. 
With the recent surge in the discussion of the well being of Perl it is time 
to finish it and post it.

A long time ago Ovid wrote a blog post titled
( <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/39357">Solutions Are Not Problems. Problems Are Problems.</a> )
and finished it with the sentence <b>Our careers depend on it.</b> 
referring to the well being of Perl. To this brian d foy reacted
that <b>it is not a good enough reason</b> and to my surprise Ovid corrected himself.

Frankly even if Perl was really like COBOL and should have been gone from the world - and 
many people try to distribute that kind of FUD - even that it is totally acceptable to people 
who have financial interest in the subject to try to protect their investment. 
Let's try not to be on some moral high-ground here or judge each other. 

Some people are in "just for the fun" others are "just for the money" and yet others have both.

<h2>Stakeholders</h2>

Let's try to group the Perl stakeholders. If I missed some groups or you 
have other comments of refinement, please do comment.

<h2>Individuals: Perl Mongers and CPAN Authors, the Perl 5 Porters</h2>

First and foremost are the Perl Mongers, CPAN authors and the Perl 5 porters around the world.
Most of them are heavily invested emotionally in Perl. They are participating as
they enjoy the technology or the community. Some have financial interest too, 
others have no financial interest at all but they together are the 
enthusiastic crowd behind the actual code.

<ul>
<li>Some of them are involved purely as hobby. They don't use Perl at work.</li>
<li>Others are using Perl at work but it is far from being the most critical 
part of their job. (e.g. a sys-admin who could do her work manually, or by 
using shell or some other programming language).</li>
<li>The third group is people who are employed as full-time Perl developers 
or run their own Perl developer company. They would probably be able to switch 
to another language as well but it will take a long time - 
probably many years - for them to reach the level of expertise they have in Perl.</li>
</ul>

This is probably the group of people we mean when we are talking about the
<b>Perl Community</b>.

In addition there are a number of people who are involved in open source projects
heavily dependent on Perl but are not on CPAN. (e.g. <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>,
<a href="http://www.webgui.org/">WebGUI</a>, <a href="http://bricolagecms.org/">Bricolage</a>)


<h2>Individuals: The people behind the closed doors</h2>

Both the people who use Perl-as-a-glue, the people who use Perl for lots of internal automation
and the full time Perl developers are represented in this group. This is probably a much bigger
group than the above - open source - section but we hardly know about their needs and wants 
as they are usually not interacting with the open source Perl community at all.

These people usually have a lot less emotional connection to Perl if anything at all
but they have an investment in Perl that should be protected. They spent time and energy
learning it, they build some expertise around it. If they need to switch to another
language this investment is partially gone.


<h2>Companies: Glue language</h2>

There are tons of places where Perl is used in critical applications but 
because it is at the sys-admin level or because it is the glue between 
the <i>"real applications"</i> higher management does not see it as having 
a strategic importance.

<h2>Perl Training Companies (and individuals)</h2>

These are the companies providing Perl training - a few have specialized for 
Perl, many provide Perl as just another technology.

The latter don't really care, they usually take people with 1-2 years 
experience in Perl and let them teach the usually outdated PERL training material. 
(Having seen some of these training materials I am not sure why are we surprised 
people new to Perl show up and write code in the style of previous century.)

The former has a real interest in making Perl more popular.
(examples: <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/">Stonehenge</a>, 
<a href="http://www.perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>, 
<a href="http://damian.conway.org/">Thoughtstream (aka Damian Conway)</a>
just to mention a few and myself). Most of these companies are run by people 
who are involved in the Perl Community.

<h2>Small Perl Development Companies</h2>

There are companies, providing application development service
using Perl (eg. based on Moose, Catalyst, Krang, Bricolage, Titanium,
Mojo or whatever else).

AFAIK Most of the companies providing these services are 
the actual developers of the mentioned applications or frameworks
and thus are already involved in the Perl Community.

<h2>Large Perl based Companies</h2>

There are larger companies using Perl in big mission-critical customer facing
applications. They have one or more applications written in Perl 
(or at least that Perl is a large part of the application). 
They recognize Perl as one of the technologies critical to their ongoing health.
Some of these companies (e.g. <a href="http://booking.com/">Booking.com</a> ) employ 
people from the Perl Community and/or have given nice sponsorship for the further 
development of Perl. There are many others but I am not sure how easy or difficult it 
could be to find them.

<h2>Non-Perl companies</h2>

There are the huge companies that we keep mentioning such as
Amazon, Yahoo, Intel, IBM that have lots of Perl code in mostly 
in-house applications. They use lots of other technologies as well. 
Because of the size of these companies and the number of different
technologies they use neither upper nor mid-level management see Perl 
as a critical technology. 

<h2>Individuals and companies selling products for Perl</h2>

For example <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> (Komodo), 
<a href="http://www.indigostar.com/">IndigoStar</a>, 
<a href="http://www.xarka.com/">Xarka</a> (OptiPerl). They too have
an interest to have more people using Perl as that will enlarge 
the market of their products and services.

Some of these companies have good relationship to the Perl community
others don't have much.

<h2>Individuals and companies selling products written in Perl</h2>

There are various CGI and other scripts written in Perl sold
by people either as a plain commercial product or as shareware.

The developers of these applications should have some interest in how
well Perl is doing but in many cases they don't care much. AFAIK usually
they are not involved in the Perl community.


<h2>Perl related foundations</h2>

<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation (TPF)</a>, 
<a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/">YAPC Europe Foundation (YEF)</a>, 
<a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/">Enlightened Perl Organization (EPO)</a>,
<a href="http://japan.perlassociation.org/">Japan Perl Association</a>,
<a href="http://www.perl.it/associazione/index.html">Italian Perl Association</a>,
and probably a few other local Perl organizations.

All of these organizations are filled by people from the Perl community
who are already volunteer their time and in cases some of their money 
too for the advancement of Perl.

<h2>Some conclusion</h2>

Let's accept that there are many individuals and companies that have clear financial
interest in the well being of the Perl ecosystem. Some of these people are even members of 
the open source Perl Community and some of these companies already support the Perl community.

Let's not be shy and talk to all of these people and companies so we can use their expertise
and money too to promote Perl so more people will be involved and to understand how to 
improve Perl and the Perl ecosystem to better serve the market. (aka marketing Perl).


<h2>Update</h2>

In October 2010 the <a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a> was established.
