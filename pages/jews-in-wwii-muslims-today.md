=head1 Comparing the Muslims today to the Jews before the Holocaust? Think again!

I am quite tired of people comparing the treatment of Muslims and Muslim refugees to
the Jews in the 30s and 40s last century.

The majority of Muslims, and especially the majority of the refugees just want to live a normal life
the same way the Jews wanted, but comparison is incorrect and dangerous.



Here is a Tweet I saw recently.

<h3><q>Scapegoating all Muslims as terrorist trying to destroy America is no different than the Germans blaming the the loss of WWI on the Jews.</q></h3>

This sounds awfully as if there were terrorist Jews who were actually plotting against Germany
during WWI. No there were not. That was the lie that was used by the Nazis.

This time however there are plenty of Muslims plotting against the USA and the Western civilization
in general. There are Muslims flying airplanes into building and killing people. Moreover there
is a large popular base for this.

<h3>Scapegoating all Muslims as terrorist trying to destroy America is disgusting and dangerous.</h3>

That's true. It has nothing to do with the lies Europeans, and Germans in particular
told themselves about Jews.

Back then there was not a single Jew calling for the destruction of Germany, Austria,
Hungary, or any of the other European country. There were no Jews killing people
in order to instill fear in the population. No Jew wanted to establish a Caliphate in Europe.

The Jews were surely blamed for that, but that was a lie.

Today, on the other hand, we see Muslims trying and succeeding in terrorizing Western nations
by blowing up buildings and killing people.
We see calls among Muslims for the destruction of the Western countries and of the Western
civilization. Not only do they talk, they also take action.

Moreover we see a lot of Muslims supporting these extremists.

So comparing Jews on the eve of WWII and the Muslims today is absolutely not correct.
Not only do these calls try to whitewash the crimes committed by Muslims and in the name of Allah,
it actually also says that the claims against the Jews back then had some basis.

Let me repeat. This does not say anything about Muslims in general.
The majority, and especially the majority of the refugees just want to live a normal life.

Help them.
