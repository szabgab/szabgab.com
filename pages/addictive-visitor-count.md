=head1 Addictive visitor count on the Rust Maven site
=timestamp 1712759416

In the past few days there was a huge jump in the visiotr count of the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) web site.
The primary cause was the post [Rust vs. C++](https://rust.code-maven.com/rust-vs-cpp) that I also shared on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1by3lle/rust_vs_c/).

I love to see so many visitors on my site, but this is addictive. Now I need it again and again.
