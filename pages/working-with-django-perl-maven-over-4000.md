=head1 Working with Django and the Perl Maven over 4000

While recently most of my paying work has been with Python, the
Perl Maven site keeps growing.



In October I ran a 3-day long <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> course,
and a client kept me busy writing an application in <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
This is the first time I use Django, and I am quite impressed. Both with the documentation
including the tutorials and the technology itself.

While I was busy with those paying jobs I had less time to write free articles for
the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site, but apparently the cumulative
effort of the past year and a half, including that of the
<a href="http://meta.perlmaven.com/">translators</a> keeps the number of visitors growing.

It was only a month ago that site first passed
<a href="/web-based-debugging-article-and-the-perl-maven-over-3000.html">3000 visitors a day</a>,
and yesterday was the first time I saw it passing 4000 visitors a single day.
(According to the <a href="https://clicky.com/66487408">Clicky</a> statistics.)
