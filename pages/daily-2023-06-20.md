Am I going to make this a habit now? Nah, even two swallows don't make summer.

(That's [swallow, the bird](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swallow+the+bird&t=ffab&iax=images&ia=images))

## Yesterday

Yesterday my afternoon workshop was cancelled and thus the whole day I was learning Rust and working on the [Rust slides](https://code-maven.com/slides/rust/). It is not easy (for me) to learn a new programming language so it went slow.

Well after preparing and sending out the [621st edition of the Perl Weekly](https://perlweekly.com/archive/621.html) that also took a few hours.

I am also listening to this podcast: [Episode 27: Leading with Values: Sid Sijbrandij joins Matt Mullenweg to talk about GitLab, Transparency and Growing a Distributed Company](https://distributed.blog/2021/05/20/episode-27-leading-with-values-sid-sijbrandij-joins-matt-mullenweg-to-talk-about-gitlab-transparency-and-growing-a-distributed-company/) and if you are interested I am using [Podcast Addict](https://podcastaddict.com/) for that.

## Today

Today, in the morning hours I'll work on [OSDC site](https://osdc.code-maven.com/) I'd like to list the projects I am working on where the participants can contribute to. [issue](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/OSDC-Code-Maven.github.io/issues/8) I also plan to list all of my other courses, but I might do this later. [issue](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/OSDC-Code-Maven.github.io/issues/9).

I opened issues with these tasks.

Then I plan to continue working on the [Rust slides](https://github.com/szabgab/slides). I won't open an issue for that.

I won't have a lot of time for this as I am going to Tel Aviv to have lunch with one friend and then tea with another friend and in the evening I am going to attend the [first Maakaf Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/maakaf/events/293187856/) about Open Source.

In between these meetings I'll listen to more podcasts, I guess. We'll see.
