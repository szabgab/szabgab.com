I am not a regular [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) user, but somtimes I open it and try to figure out how it works.

A couple of days ago I noticed that there are a number of Python-related accounts with more than a million followers.
I looked for Rust-related accounts I could only find a few mostly inactive account that had only a few thousand followers.

It is either that Rust developers are not on Instagram, or that so far no one put enough energy into making a popular account.

As having a popular Instagram account about Rust might fit will with my [plans with Rust](/plans-with-rust) I thought I'll try make one.

So welcome to the [Rust Maven on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rust_maven/).

=abstract end

I already had an account called Code Maven with a few followers, but only two posts. I renamed the account to [Rust Maven](https://www.instagram.com/rust_maven/),
removed the old posts and published a few images of code. I mentioned it in the [Rust Maven newsletter](https://rust.code-maven.com/subscribe) and posted about it
in the [Rust Programming Language Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/872919370237098). I got a few new followers and a few likes.

I know it will be a long process to get tracktion there, but let's do some analyzis of what is out there.

In each group the accounts are ordered by number of followers

## Goals

Frankly I don't know what would be realistic goals. The first milestone would 

<style>
table td + td {
    text-align: right;
}
table td + td + td {
    text-align: right;
}
table td + td + td + td {
    text-align: right;
}
</style>
