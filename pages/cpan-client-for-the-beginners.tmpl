<i>Every time I go to run CPAN for some reason there's more to configure.  Woe.
and it asks you all kinds of questions. Yeah, some of which I don't know what
the best answer is to. I just get choice overload.</i>

The above is a quote from <a href="http://foxfirefey.dreamwidth.org/">foxfirefey</a>
who seems to be a nice person as she helped me a lot with here comments that lead
to my previous posts <a href="/improving-the-moose-experience.html">Improving the Moose experience</a> and <a href="/improving-the-padre-experience.html">Improving the Padre experience</a>.
She just isn't a power user of Perl.

Actually I get comments with similar content but in a much ruder way from other
people, some of them with many years of experience.

<a href="http://www.strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl for Windows</a> has
a CPAN client that does not need any configuration. I hope someone with the right
powers and tuits will make it sure that the cpan clients that come with the Linux
distributions are also going to need 0 configuration.
