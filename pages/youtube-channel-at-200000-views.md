Almost exactly a year ago, on 13 July 2015 I've celebrated the [100,000 views](/youtube-channel-at-100000) on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/gabor529). Then on 9 May 2016 it has passed the [1,000 subscribers](/youtube-channel-at-1000-subscribers).

Today I can celebrate again reaching 200,000 views.

The channel was created on May 19, 2007 so it took just a bit over 8 years to have the first 100,000 views, but the second 100,000
views came in 1 year and 12 days.

Today there are 277 videos in the channel including
* 188 of the [Beginner Perl Maven video course](https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course),
* 10 [interviews](https://perlmaven.com/search/interview),
* 8 [videos about Perl 6](/perl6),
* 16 in the [SCO cloning project](https://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org),
* 13 from the [Test automation with Perl](https://perlmaven.com/testing) series,
and a few more about Perl 5.

There are 1,102 subscribers.

In the last 28 days there were 5,706 views and the estimated minutes watched was 11,949.

So despite having a lot more videos than a year ago, the number of views / day does not seem to be growing accordingly.

Maybe if I was publishing videos about more popular subjects.
