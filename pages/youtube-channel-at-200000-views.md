Almost exactly a year ago, on 13 July 2015 I've celebrated the <a href="http://szabgab.com/youtube-channel-at-100000.html">100,000 views</a> on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gabor529"></a>YouTube channel</a>. Then on 9 May 2016 it has
passed the <a href="http://szabgab.com/youtube-channel-at-1000-subscribers.html">1,000 subscribers</a>.

Today I can celebrate again reaching 200,000 views.

=abstract end

The channel was created on May 19, 2007 so it took just a bit over 8 years to have the first 100,000 views, but the second 100,000
views came in 1 year and 12 days.

Today there are 277 videos in the channel including 188 of the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course">Beginner Perl Maven video course</a>,
10 <a href="http://perlmaven.com/search/interview">interviews</a>,
8 <a href="http://szabgab.com/perl6.html">videos about Perl 6</a>,
16 in the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org">SCO cloning project</a>, 
13 from the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/testing">Test automation with Perl</a> series, 
and a few more about Perl 5.

There are 1,102 subscribers.

In the last 28 days there were 5,706 views and the estimated minutes watched was 11,949.

So despite having a lot more videos than a year ago, the number of views / day does not seem to be growing accordingly.

Maybe if I was publishing videos about more popular subjects.
