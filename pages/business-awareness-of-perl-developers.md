Once I wrote a post about the <a href="http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/21896">business readiness of various programming languages</a>
by comparing the number of people in <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> mentioning the name of the language.
This cannot be done any more but now I found another interesting way to measure.

I checked the LinkedIn groups dedicated to specific languages and there I can see the
number of members. It is far from being scientific but it is interesting.

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

 .NET       37,586
 Java       33,080
 PHP        16,609
 Python      9,538
 Javascript  8,506
 Ruby        8,412
 Perl        3,891

<h2>Perl</h2>

The biggest group is the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=40830">Perl Mongers</a> group with 3,891 members
that was setup by Jos√© Castro when he was doing the communication of The Perl Foundation.

There are also other groups I have not seen earlier such as the 
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=106254">Perl</a> group with 2,808 members and the
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1332857">Perl Jobs</a> group with 760 members
both owned by Dariusz Jackowski.
There is also a group dedicated to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=39178">The Perl Foundation</a> with 102 members 
which is owned by Marco Lima.

There are many other, smaller groups mostly related to specific Perl Monger groups.

There are some other Perl related groups as well. 

For example There are 3 
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=971957">Webgui</a> 
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=47444">related</a>
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2051852">groups</a> with 129, 53 and 11 members respectively.

The <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=74787">Bricolage group</a> has 20 members.
The <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1734207">Catalyst group</a> has 70 members.
The <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2460957">Padre group</a> has 30 members.

<h2>Python</h2>

The <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=25827">Python Community</a> has 9,538 members
and the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=50788">Django group</a> has 3,492 members.

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=22413">Ruby on Rails</a> has a group with 8,412 members.
the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=120725">Rubyists group</a> has 2,744 members
There is another <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=109785">RoR (Ruby on Rails) group</a>
with 1,643 members. 
What is very interesting to me is that there is also a group called
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=27822">Business on Rails</a> with 1,460 members.

There are several more Ruby related groups.

<h2>PHP</h2>

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=40870">LinkedPHPers</a> with 16,609 members.
There is a smaller group called <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=42140">Php developers</a>
with 7,324 members.

There are several groups for Drupal. The biggest is just called 
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=35920">Drupal</a> and it has 6,875 members.


<h2>Java</h2>

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=70526">Java Developers</a> is the biggest Java related
group with 33,080 members.

<h2>.NET</a>

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=40717">.NET People</a> has 37,586 members.

<h2>Javascript</h2>

The group called <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=121615">Javascipt</a> has only 1,988 members
but the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=100943">JQuery</a> group has 5,196 members and there
is a group called <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=121615">Rich Internet Applications (RIA)</a>
uniting the various Javascript based frameworks with 8,506 members.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I am sure you can all draw your own conclusion. 

Mine is that the Perl community is the least business aware among the languages
I checked and maybe it is time to send out another call to all the Perl users to
join the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=40830">Perl Mongers</a> group
on LinkedIn.

I'll check these numbers a week from now again to see if there is any 
significant change.
