=tags Perl, testing, course



I have two public Test Automation Training courses scheduled:

The first one is planned to be on 10-11 May, the two days before
<a href="http://event.perlrussia.org/yr2012/">Perl Mova and YAPC::Russia</a>
in Kiev, Ukraine. If you are interested in this training, make sure you
<a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> ASAP.

The second one is
<a href="http://yapcna.org/conference/testing-workshop">Testing Workshop</a>
11-12 June 2012 in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, just before
<a href="http://yapcna.org/">YAPC::NA</a>.
You can register on the web site.




The 2-days class will include both lectures and hands on exercises.
Therefore the participants are requested to bring their own notebook
machine to be able to enjoy the whole course.

The assumption is that people are familiar with Perl but have little or
no experience in writing tests in Perl.

In the first 3/4 of the course we'll learn about the testing framework
available in Perl (TAP and the Test::* modules). In last 1/4
we are going to learn about various tools to interact with external
system (e.g. Databases, Web applications, Networking devices, CLI).

After the course the participants will be able to write test for their
applications. They will be able to setup a simple smoke testing
environment to run regression tests, collect the results,
and create nice reports.

During the class we'll be talking about unit, integration,
system and even acceptance testing with both white- and
black-box testing in mind.


The planned 4 parts of the training. (There might be
some changes, but more or less this is how the parts
will work out.)

<ul>
<li>Introduction to testing, why, when, who and how ?</li>
<li>Understanding the basic tasks of the QA engineer</li>
<li>Introduction to TAP - the Test Anything Protocol</li>
<li>Testing tools in Perl for testing Perl Modules (Test::Simple, Test::More)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Common reporting framework (Test::Harness)</li>
<li>Extending the testing framework (Test::Builder)</li>
<li>Other testing modules including Test::Most, Test::Deep</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>More from Test::* (e.g. Test::Warn, Test::Exception)</li>
<li>Setting up continuous integration (smoke testing)</li>
<li>Report integration with Smolder</li>
<li>Command Line Interface (CLI) applications</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Testing network devices</li>
<li>Testing Web application</li>
<li>Examples for database testing</li>
<li>If time permits also Testing file-systems</li>

</ul>

The class will be given in English.
Participants are expected to bring their own computer to do the exercises.
