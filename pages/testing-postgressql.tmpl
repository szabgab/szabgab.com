<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> is one of the leading 
Open Source databases. While it has a smaller installed base than MySQL
it is usually regarded to be more robust with more features than any other
Open Source Database.

<h2>Development</h2>

Source code is kept in CVS. 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/developer/sourcecode/">See instructions</a> on how to
get it. There is a 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.FAQ_DEV.html">huge set of documentation</a>
on how to get involved in the development of PostgreSQL.

The team provides <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/dev/">nightly code builds</a>, 
though the last one was on the 10th August and today is the 21st. 
It seems they had a long night there.

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h2>Automated testing</h2>

PostgreSQL has a <a href="http://www.pgbuildfarm.org/">distributed build farm</a>
consisting, partially their own, partially volunteers</li>

The build-farm itself is written in Perl, it has it own 
<a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgbuildfarm/">separate project page</a>.
The main page of the build-farm has a link to the documentation on 
<a href="http://pgfoundry.org/docman/view.php/1000040/4/PGBuildFarm-HOWTO.txt">
how to setup a client</a>. It looks frightening, but actually it is a 
lot simpler than what the text looks like. Actually before you do that
you have to first login to the CVS server as described on the 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/developer/sourcecode/">Source Code Repository</a>
page.

They require a bunch of Perl modules - most of them are standard - so 
they should not get people worried right at the beginning. They might
also want to add instructions on how to install the missing modules.

The configuration files is a bit funny as it is a Perl data structure.

AFAIK they should move to something with less parentheses such as an 
INI file or YAML.


The smoke testing client can run the whole build/testing cycle.
Each client has a single configuration and that is what it is testing


Before one can actually send the test result s/he needs to 
<a href="http://www.pgbuildfarm.org/register.html">register</a>.
During registration I had to provide Operating System, OS Version, Compiler
Compiler Version, Architecture, my name and e-mail.
I gave the following values (Ubuntu, 7.04, gcc, 4.1.2, i686) answering the first 
five questions. I am still not sure if that's what they meant by architecture
and why don't they collect this information during by the client. What if I
upgrade my machine and forget to tell them? Will they notice it?
What if I want to setup another client on another machine? Do I need to register again?

I like the fact that I need to provide a verifiable e-mail with my report. 
While this make reporting slightly more difficult at the beginning, if 
I happen to send bogus reports by mistake, they can easily contact me.

Using a username and password also reduces the risk of someone else sending bogus 
reports in my name.

While trying to setup the client, on the first run I got the following, quite cryptic
error message:
<b>Stage Configure failed with status 77</b>
First it seemed as an actual failure in the code base of PostgreSQL but after 
some research I found several log files in the <i>HEAD/lastrun-logs/</i>
that pointed me to my error. I have not installed ccache. I bumped into another
problem till I got my smoke client up but eventually it worked. 
I was waiting for them to process my request to join the build farm for several days.
That's a bit disappointing, though it is August. So it might be just because of the
Holidays.

The <a href="http://www.pgbuildfarm.org/cgi-bin/show_status.pl">status page
of the PostgreSQL Build Farm</a> is very nice. On the main page you can
see the latest status of each machine. Success/failure and when was it 
last reported. They have cute flags to show what flags are on for that
particular build machine. (I wonder why not let the same machine run 
several configurations one after the other.)
Clicking on the "Config" link they provide a drill down to the many phases of
the smoke testing. Starting by checking out from CVS, configuring, building
and running several tests.

They also provide a history for the specific machine to see when did it 
run previously and what were the results.

BTW I found this article about

<h2>TODO</h2>
See how tests are written and how can one add a new test.
