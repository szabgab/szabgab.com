=head1 Announcing the "Test Automation using Perl" e-book

=tags Perl, testing e-book

=abstract start

For many years I believed that testing, and writing automated test
is one of the fields where Perl can shine.

The Perl community has a very strong social culture of writing tests.

It is a social pressure much stronger than the expectation to write documentation.

This provides the background for Perl to be a great language for writing
automated test. Not only for applications written in Perl, but for any application.

The <b>Test Automation using Perl</b> e-book aims to help people learn
<b>how to write unit tests</b> for their Perl modules and <b>how to use Perl to test anything</b>,

If I was a good sales person, I'd have made lots of noise and get
you all really enthusiastic about the upcoming e-book.

Instead of that, I just decided I should go forward with the
publication and made the e-book available for early birds.

The <a href="http://perlmaven.com/test-automation-using-perl-e-book">Test Automation using Perl e-book</a>
is based on the material I have been using in the training classes in the last couple of years.

It contains the slides extended with the narrative.

It is not "finished" in the sense that I am going to add a lot more
material to it, but it is already quite good. I think.

The reason I decided to go forward and make it available now,
instead of waiting till it is "finished" is that it would be
great to get feed-back from the readers.

The income is also not neglectable. I could ask for some kick-start
money, telling people I'll work really hard to produce the material,
but I think the people who put some money on the table should
already get some value in return. Like now.

And they get quite a lot.

The current version of the e-book is in PDF format and has 162 pages.

The first part introduces the testing framework of Perl,
the Test Anything Protocol (TAP) and a number of modules
in the Test::* namespace.

The second half introduces various techniques interacting
with databases, web sites, command line interface (CLI)
and even MS Windows desktop applications.

Oh and it is available at an early-bird discount rate.
Less than 50% of the full price.

Oh and if you
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/test-automation-using-perl-e-book">buy it now</a>,
you will get all future updates as well. Without any further payment.
