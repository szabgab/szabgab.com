I just talked to our <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?alberto_sim%C3%B5es">video guy</a>
as he now calls himself, he refused to blog (but I saw him
<a href="http://twitter.com/albertovski/status/4315307524">tweeting</a>) that finally the
recording of <a href="http://videos.sapo.pt/yapc">Larry Wall speaking about Perl 6 in Lisbon</a>
is available.

Other recordings will follow in a week or so.
