=head1 The Social Padre: Facebook like button

After adding a  <a href="/the-social-padre-google-plus.html">Google +1 button</a> to the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>
website now I also added the Facebook like button. So far Google leads 54:32 but Facebook has 
the advantage of showing the faces of my friends who liked it. I think it has a very 
powerful effect to see that people I know already trust or like something.

OTOH among geeks the both Facebook, Google+ and the whole "social networking" thing might be 
seen as something negative. Certainly I see some people pretending they don't care.
It must be some kind of a geek-cool thing. I was left out. Again. :-(

Facebook has a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lint/>lint</a> tool that will do
some analysis to your web page and then provide the HTML code to be be embedded in order to
get the <b>like</b> button. I checked 
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lint/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fperl.org%2F">perl.org</a>
and there are 267 people who liked it. Even though AFAIK it does not have a like button on the
web site itself.

Anyway, if you think Padre is an important project for Perl, even if you personally don't use it
and if you are either a Facebook user or a Google+ user then it is now only two clicks away to 
give a little bit of endorsement to <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>.
