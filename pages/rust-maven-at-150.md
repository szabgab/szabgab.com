=head1 Rust Maven at 150 articles
=timestamp 1710425072
=tags Rust



I just realized that almost 2 months passes since I sent the most recent email update to the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) subscribers.

It is not that I have not written anything, I just did not send messages.

So I wrote one and pointed at the [archive](https://rust.code-maven.com/archive) as well where they can find all the posts. It turns out I've just hit 150 published articles there.

Let's celebrate.



In the last 3 weeks or so I have been recording a [video series in Hebrew teaching Rust](https://he.code-maven.com/rust). This is the 3rd attempt to record a course. The first two were almost 6 months ago.
I learnt a lot since then and I also totally changed the style. Instead of using the slides, I am live coding the whole thing. I enjoy it a lot and making nice progress.
