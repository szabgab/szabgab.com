As reported elsewhere the first super easy Padre installer for Windows
was released last week.

It is now called the <b>Almost Six</b> package as it contains a development version of
Rakudo Perl 6.

Almost six contains the following packages:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl 5.10 for Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6</a> release #19 ("Chicago")</li>
<li><a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> version 0.41</li>
<li>Padre::Plugin::Perl6 v0.55</li>
</ul>

It is very easy to 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/download.html">download</a> the msi
package and then install it as you would install any other Windows application.

Then you can start writing either Perl 5 or Perl 6 code.

I was on YAPC::EU in the last 3 days but there almost everyone is using Linux
or Mac OSX. So I wonder what do you people suggest? How can we attract Windows
users who write Perl code to try Padre an give us feedback?
