=timestamp 1260987335
=tags Perl, Israel, Rehovot, PDL, Padre

I am sorry for the delay in the announcement but I am having a
busy time wrestling with both clients and <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>
as I would like to make sure the debugger already works in the next version.
Anyway the next meeting of <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/">Rehovot Perl Mongers</a>
will take place on 22 December, between 18:00-22:00 in the 
<a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/">Weizmann Institute</a>. For directions
take a look at the web site of the Rehovot Perl Mongers.

On this meeting <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hadarleviaharoni">Hadar Levi</a> will give
another talk, this time about PDL::Indexing explaining
the basics of indexing and threading in 
<a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">PDL, The Perl Data Language</a>

I think I'll use some time to give you a deeper introduction to 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>. I'll plan to look at

<ol>
<li>How the debugger was added (and by that time it should be past tense)
<li>How to add a simple plug-in.
</ol>

If there is interest - as I'll ask on the spot - I'll give a short
introduction to Perl. Either to everyone or to the smaller group
who are new(ish) to Perl.

After that we <b>will</b> have exercises bot to beginners and more advanced
users.

Please RSVP to my <a href="/contact.html">e-mail address</a> if you are planning to come.

Please also tell other parties about this meeting and also urge them to sign up to either 
of our mailing lists that are relevant to them 
<a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/Rehovot-pm">Rehovot.pm mailing list</a>
or <a href <a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/perl">Israel.pm mailing list</a>
