I have been struggling with what I am doing for quite some time.

I keep
<a href="http://szabgab.com/the-popularity-of-perl-in-2015.html">seeing the evidence</a> that the user-base of Perl
is shrinking. While you can't see from <a href="http://szabgab.com/2015.html">these numbers</a>, but the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> has not gaing more readers since February 2015.

But I still love to explain stuff about Perl.



For almost 2 month I have not published any articles for the Perl Maven Pro users.
Mostly because I was way too busy at my clients.

Then about a month ago I posted a <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2016/01/earn-money-with-your-perl-articles.html">call for authors</a>.
It took some time, but it seems soon we are going to see articles from other authors as well.

In the meantime, while still very busy at my clients, I had a new surge in energy and managed to publish 7 articles in the last 9 days.

Some of those were about plain JavaScript, some about AngularJS, but the majority was still Perl.

I thought I should actually focus a lot more on things that are not Perl. Technologies that attract a lot more interest these days.

I could merge the back-end and the userbase of the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site, the <a href="http://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a>
site and maybe even the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> site.

Then it would make a lot more sense to convert the "Perl Maven Pro" subscribers to "Code Maven Pro" subscribers and give them articles about everything.
Including Perl.
