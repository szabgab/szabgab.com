Do you know <a href="http://railsrumble.com">Rails Rumble</a> or <a href=" http://nodeknockout.com/">Node Knockout</a>?

They are both 48-hour long, on-line competitions, or hackathons if you wish
for the respective communities. They build beautiful things during these competitions.

It's time time that we, in the Perl community will have our own competition!

Let me announce the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven Competition</a>

=abstract end

The idea is, that you put together small teams - up to 4 people in each team.
During a virtual weekend in December 2012, we get together - virtually, that is -
and build the most awesome things we can. In just 48 hours.

You can build anything.

One big requirement is that you build an end-user product.
Most likely that will include a web interface,
but I am not sure we will have that restriction.

There will be judges, and voting, and prizes, we "just" have to organize all this.

As you can understand this whole thing is quite early stages,
but we have more than 2 months.

<h2>So what now?</h2>

So go ahead, <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">read about the competition</a>.
If you have any questions, ask me on this blog, or ask me via e-mail.

Participants will have to register thought egistration will be open only later,
closer to the event. There is a newsletter where I am going to
post about the progress in the organization, including the registration date.

<a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Go ahead, subscribe there</a>
or let me know in some other way that you are interested.
