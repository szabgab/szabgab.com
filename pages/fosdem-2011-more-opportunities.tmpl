There are several ways to participate at 
<a href="http://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> in February 2011.

We are organizing talks in the <b>Perl devroom</b> on Sunday.
See my previous post about the
<a href="/blog/2010/11/fosdem-call-for-perl-related-talks.html">call for Perl related talks</a>

The request for a <b>Perl stand</b> was submitted. Decision will be made
around 14 December if it is accepted or not.

There is a track of 15 minute long talks at FOSDEM called 
"<b>Lightning talks</b>".
They provide an opportunity to give a short talk about any project
outside of the devrooms. I can even imagine that 3 people submit together 
one talk proposal and give 3 5-min talk in there. Just to show how it is done on
Perl conferences. 
See the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/call_for_lightningtalks">call for Lightning talks</a>.

Other devroom
If you have a solution to some problem, IMHO it is better to show
it in a place where people dealing with that problem can be found 
and not where the people who use the same technology you used can be found.
So if you wrote a OOP for Perl then of course the best place to
show it is the Perl devroom. On the other hand if you have a 
solution to a problem related to, let's say,
"Configuration/Systems Management" then it is probably better to
show it in the "Configuration/Systems Management" devroom and not 
in the Perl devroom.

So I'd like to encourage everyone to check out the 
<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/news/accepted-devrooms">list of accepted devrooms</a>
and check out the call for presentations of the <b>other devrooms</b> as posted
on the <a href="http://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/">FOSDEM mailing list</a>.


There is also going to be a <b>Distribution miniconf</b> during FOSDEM.
This is an area where talks are about thing common to various
Linux (and BSD) distributions. Last year I gave a talk about CPAN
and how the "upstream" (CPAN developers) could better interact with the
"downstream" - the Linux and BSD distributions.
Details are <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/distrominiconf">here</a>.

We are also planning to organize a <b>Perl 6 and a Dancer hackathon</b>
either before or after FOSDEM. Further announcements will come soon.


In the <a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a>
we already have some budget to finance the participation of a few people
on FOSDEM. Therefore if you think about someone who would be
a particularly good speaker at FOSDEM but who need some help
in financing flight and accommodation, please let us know.
