When I started to write this blog I used the timetamp of each post as the name of
the page where the entry shows up. A couple of monthes ago a new feature was added that 
allowed the creation of the textual addresses. It is probably better for SEO
but it makes it also easier for me to recognize in the logs which page are people 
visiting a lot.

Today I finished converting all my previous blog entries so they too will have such textual
address. I setup redirections from the old pages to the new ones.

This means that if you linked to any of my pages those links should still work.

Nevertheless it would be nicer if all the links pointed to the new addresses. So if 
you have linked to one of my blog entries I'd appreciate if you could replace them 
with the new link.

I already went over the links on the about page of
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/about.html">The Perl Editor</a> and replaced
them.

Which reminds me <a href="http://ahmadzawawi.blogspot.com/">Ahmad Zawawi</a> made some 
wonderful development that will soon show up in Padre fixing one of 
the most embarrassing issues we had.
