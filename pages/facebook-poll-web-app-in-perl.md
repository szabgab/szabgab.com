=head1 Facebook poll about a Perl-based web app

=tags Facebook, poll, Perl



On August 21, 2020 I posted a poll in the two Perl-related groups on Facebook.

In the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/permalink/3497755593590537/">Perl programmers</a> group (4,494 members)
and in the  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/permalink/799896940817934/">The Perl Community</a> group (564 members).

There were not many votes, but the results surprised me:



<h2>Question</h2>

Would it be interesting to you to see step-by-step how I develop an open source web application in Perl? (Together with testing, setting up CI, Docker, and deployment)
Would you be ready to support it via Patreon?

The last option, being already a contributor was added by Mark Gardner and then also upvoted by Zahir Lalani. (thanks for your support!)
