Originally the plan was to create some kind of a database where it would be easy for me to
check if a given person was on <a href="http://xcast.szabgab.com/">any of the podcasts</a>.

I also wanted to make it easy to look-up the list of recorded presentations of that person.

That could turn into something similar to the <a href="http://perltv.org/">PerlTV</a> just more popular.
I found there is a site called <a href="http://pyvideo.org/">PyVideo</a> that is quite similar to the PerlTV just for Python.
I have not found other similar sites.

I think the idea to collect the conference videos brought me the idea of the list of <a href="http://conferences.szabgab.com/">future conferences</a> as well.

So what is the plan now?

<ul>
<li>Collect the <a href="http://conferences.szabgab.com/">list of conferences</a> with the primary focus on future events.</li>
<li>Collect the list of video recordings from these conferences. Probably avoiding the videos from pyvideo.org or somehow integrating those.</li>
<li>Collect <a href="http://xcast.szabgab.com/">the podcasts</a> and the episodes of the podcasts.</li>
<li>Have a list of people that can be used by the last two sites.</li>
</ul>
