=timestamp 1248779079
=tags Padre, Perl, IDE, YAPC, Lisbon, BOF

I just went over the 
<a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/wiki?node=SuggestedBOFs">list of BOFs at YAPC::EU</a>.
added myself to the Rakudo, the Marketing and the Perl Trainers BOF and created
a <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/wiki?node=PadreBOF">Padre BOF</a>.

If you are coming to YAPC::EU and you'd like to setup padre or have a 
discussion about it then please either find me in the corridors or better
yet sign up to the BOF and we'll try to organize a meeting. Hopefully
not at the same time as one of my other BOFs.
