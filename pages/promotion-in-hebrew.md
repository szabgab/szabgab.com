Ideas about the channels where we could promote the Python and Rust-related content, events, and services.

The goal is to reach a lot more people with the events and the videos to make people think about me when they are looking for a Rust or a Python trainer in Israel so they will recommend me to their bosses.

The more immediate goal is to help more people enjoy the valuable content we create.

* Meetup groups:
    * [PyWeb-IL](https://www.meetup.com/pyweb-il/)
    * [Rust-TLV](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/)
    * Write title with Hebrew text.
    * Create nice banners with Hebrew text or make it obvious in some other way that the event is in Hebrew.
* [Hebrew YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@code-maven-in-hebrew)
    * Thumbnails (make them nicer and obvious that they are in Hebrew)
    * Titles in Hebrew (as well?)
    * Maybe also some Hebrew text for the descriptions.

* Hebrew web sites:
    * Update the text, fixing typos,  adding more descriptions.
