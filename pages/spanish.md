=head1 Resources for learning Spanish

=tags Spanish



I have been learning Spanish for a few weeks now and during that time I've collected a few resources that I found useful.
Some of them are already good for me as a begginner, the other are mostly for when I start to know more.

Some I have not tried myself but might be useful for you.



<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> is a web site and a mobile app with which you can learn many different
languages including Spanish. These days I commute to work. About 40 min by train twice a day. It could be a lot of
wasted time but I spend a lot of it using Duolingo. Once in a while I also check my progress on <a
href="https://www.duome.eu/">Duome</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeiOtq3Uh0wmviSPQnHVOg">Spanish with Alma</a> is a YouTube channel for beginner Spanish students.
I know Alma González as she is also a teach on Italki. She also has a web site called <a href="https://www.spanishwithalma.com/">Spanish with Alma</a>.

<a href="https://www.italki.com/i/EFbbfc?hl=en_us">italki</a> is a web site and a mobile application through which you can find chat partners for free or teacher for a reasonable price. The fun part is that the other person can be from the other side of the world. Once you found the partner/teacher you conduct your online meetings via Skype or some other, similar too. Prices for teachers seem to range between $4-$80/hour depending on the language, the location of the teacher, and I guess how much they value themselves. I found a teacher from Spain.  (This is an affiliate link. As I understand if you use to sign up we'll both get some credit.)

I heard <a href="https://languatalk.com/">LanguaTalk</a> is a nice alternative for finding teachers, but I have not tried it yet.

<h2>Podcasts / mp3 files</h2>

You can listen to these either by using your web browser or by a podcast listener.
(I use <a href="http://podcastaddict.fr/about/">Podcast Addict</a> as I've explained in my <a href="/podcasts.html">list of technical podcasts</a>.


Ben and Marina from <a href="https://www.notesinspanish.com/">Notes in Spanish</a> are great. You can download the episodes free of charge. They are just mp3 files and listen to them while commuting or while doing your other things that don't need your full attention. You can also buy the worksheets. The Inspired Beginner series can be understood after juts a few days or weeks of learning Spanish.  They have tons of explanations in English and then they speak in Spanish.

Beatriz and Reyes from <a href="http://podcastsinspanish.org/">Podcast in Spanish</a> are fun. These are 2-minutes long conversations in Spanish only. They speak very fast, but if you listen to the same episode 4-5 times you start to understand the individual words
and after a few weeks (or maybe months) of learning Spanish about 1 hour a day you can start understand them.

<a href="https://www.unlimitedspanish.com/">Unlimited Spanish</a> by Òscar Pellus. In every episode he takes a subject
and teaches words and expressions around that subject. After 4-6 month of learning Spanish I've started to understand
him. I love this podcast!


<a href="https://podcast.duolingo.com/">Duolingo Spanis podcast</a> - the epsiodes are mixing English and Spanish and
cover interesting personal topics.

<a href="https://www.newsinslowspanish.com/">News in Slow Spanish</a> has short free episodes and longer ones for which
you have to pay.

<a href="https://www.hoyhablamos.com/">Hoy Hablamos</a> is a great podcast by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roi/">Roi Bolás</a> and Paco.

<h2>Books</h2>

There are plenty of books (and e-books) written especially for beginners. Some of them are categorized using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">CEFR</a> catagory system.
So if you are beginner you can pick books that are marked as <b>A1</b>.

Juan Fernández (who also has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHJ7PkM6T92LwgJgrnDhWA">YouTube videos</a>) has a bunch of
<a href="https://www.1001reasonstolearnspanish.com/">books for Spanish learners</a> called
<a href="https://www.1001reasonstolearnspanish.com/historias-para-aprender-espanol/">Historias cortas para estudiantes
de español</a>. In addition he has a few <a href="https://1001-reasons-to-learn-spanish.teachable.com/">courses to learn Spanish</a>.

The books of Juan Fernández:
<ul>
<li>Hola Lola A1</li>
<li>Un hombre fascinante A1/A2</li>
<li>La profe de español A2</li>
<li>Año nuevo, vida nueva B1</li>
<li>Me voy o me quedo? B1</li>
<li>Fantasmas de Pasado B1</li>
<li>Una chica triste B2Historia del año B2</li>
</ul>


I also liked the <a href="https://www.spanishnovels.net/">Spanish books of Paco Ardit</a>.

<a href="https://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/">Olly Richards</a> has
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Olly-Richards/e/B0106FXD2U/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1">books in several languages</a>

If you use Kindle, you can also buy a Spanish dictionary and then you can highlight a word in the book you are reading
and get a translation.

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLz8oRNTKns">this video</a> Juan suggests a number of other channels:

<h2>Music</h2>

There are tons of songs in Spanish and the lyrics is available all over the Internet. I've created an account on <a
href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, but I guess you can find tons of songs in other channels as well.


<h2>Telenovela</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=extra+espanol">Extra in Spanish</a> is a telenovela especially for beginners.
It is very cheesy, but it is fun.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUXI-p1GluY&list=PLlpTGFsKPu1l4_qv6SORBJ0m5bQFZK_4l">Señora Acero</a> is another telenovella. It was a bit too difficult for me when I tried it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=destinos+episodo">Destinos</a>

<h2>Dictionary / Translator</h2>

I use <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> and the same application that has an off-line version so I can also use it when my train is in a tunnel.

<h2>Reading the news or listening to the news</h2>

It is still very difficult for me and I hardly understand anything, but here are a few:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/">CNN en Español</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo">BBC en Español</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.telemundo.com/noticias">Telemundo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://elpais.com/">El Pais</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>In person events</h2>

Duolingo has a platform called <a href="https://events.duolingo.com/">Duoling events</a> that allows you or other to organize in-person meeting among people who learn the same language. I became an ambassador for Duolingo in Spanish and English. (A volunteer to organize events.)

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> is a generic platform to organize events. I found two language related groups near-by, but neither of them really fit my needs due to their schedule so I created my own. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/lunch-tlv/">Lunch in Spanish/English in Tel Aviv</a>.
There are two other groups I found near-by:
The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Tel-Aviv-Cool-Language-Exchange/">Tel Aviv Cool Language Exchange</a> and
the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Language-Learning-in-Tel-Aviv/">Language Learning in Tel Aviv</a> that hosts the
<a href="https://www.fluentlv.com/"></a> events. I have not attended either of those, but they both look fun.

You might find a group near where you live.


<h2>Speaking</h2>

I think one of the most difficult parts is to start to talk in Spanish. I have mentioned several possibilities:
italki, Duolingo events, Meetup events.

<h2>Other</h2>

<a href="https://www.sonolibro.com/audiolibros/aventuras">Audio books</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpbJDXYuoZsQxEHa6XM2CA">Telemundo Entretenimiento</a>. Especially <b>Suelta la sopa</b>.

Listen to the radio: There are various apps for mobile phones that allow you to listen to radios from all over the world. There are tons of Spanish channels to listen to.
I personally use <a href="https://tunein.com/">Tune In</a>.

Watching movies in Spanish in <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> (or elsewhere).
