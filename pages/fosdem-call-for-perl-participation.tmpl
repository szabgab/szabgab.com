=head1 FOSDEM call for Perl participation

=tags Perl, FOSDEM, conferences, CMS, networking

I already wrote about <a href="/perl-at-fosdem.html">Perl at FOSDEM</a>, now I have more news. 
The developer rooms are now going to be topic specific as described in 
<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2010/call-developer-rooms">Call For Developer Rooms</a>.
and these are discussed on a mailing list. So far there were two rooms suggested.

One for Content Management Systems (CMS), the other one for Network configuration tools.
I think in both areas there are many tools and applications in Perl that could be presented
in the respective developer rooms. So I think this can be a great opportunity to 
show your project and promote both your project and Perl itself.

If you need help with contacting the right people, please 
<a href="/contac.html">talk to me</a> either on IRC or via e-mail or 
even by phone.
