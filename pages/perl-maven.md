<h2>Perl Maven</h2>

Since I finished my latest big contract in July, I was
trying to figure out how to earn a living with more teaching and
more writing. By creating valuable content.

I read quite a lot of blogs about business and blogging, and arrived
to the conclusion, that I need to separate the technical content
of my blog from the other, community related writings.

<h2>Reputation</h2>

I think I managed to build quite a good reputation being
a Perl trainer here in Israel, and I had a few very
successful classes in other countries as well.

Those classes in other countries were mostly filled by luck
and the help of some very nice local Perl Mongers.
I never invested enough thought on how to drive those training
classes to be more regular.

If I think about it, most people in the Perl
community are not even aware of my existence,
let alone, that I am offering
<a href="/training.html">Perl training classes around the world</a>.

So I decided I'll setup a separate domain,
move all the Perl related technical content
there (with the appropriate redirection)
and build that site into the number one source
for <b>learning Perl</b>.

Big plans.

I even stopped writing my <a href="/perl-tutorial">Perl tutorial</a>
as I thought I'll re-launch it on the new site.

<h2>The kick</h2>

In the meantime, a month ago, Mithaldu started to rant about
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mithaldu/2011/10/how-do-newbies-find-perl-learning-materials-online.html">the sad
state of the Perl tutorials</a> that prompted a few blog posts, including one from
Dave Cross, who <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2011/10/perl-tutorial/">analyzed the top 10 hits</a>
for the phrase <b>perl tutorial</b>.

I was happy to note that he found mine worth sharing with others.
I had to use this opportunity to restart the writing of my
<a href="/perl-tutorial">Perl tutorial</a>.

Since then I wrote 15 episodes for the Perl tutorial and 6 other posts.


<h2>So what is Perl Maven?</h2>

According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven">the source of all truth</a> a maven
is a trusted expert in a particular field, who seeks to pass knowledge on to others.

I love this!

I am going to call my new site <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a>. Don't click yet!

I still have not managed to build the site.

In the meantime I'll keep posting my writings here, but with the launch of the
<a href="/beginner-perl-maven.html">Beginner Perl Maven video course</a> and the
<a href="/advanced-perl-maven.html">Advanced Perl Maven video course</a>
I started to use the name.

That's it.

For now.

Now you can go back and sign up to either of the online video courses.
