In think New Year's resolutions are about what people want to change in their life.
So what are mid-year resolutions about?

Are they about what to continue to do?

In this year so far I managed to bring the Perl Maven site from 1,000 daily visitors to 2,200
and then <a href="/the-price-of-redirection.html">back to 1,000 again</a>.

I am doing the first part again.

I've started to follow the <a href="http://plainblackguy.tumblr.com/">writings of JT Smith</a>.
Some of his advice even fits my situation.

One thing, that I think he already helped me is that I think I have a better focus for the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site. At least in my mind.
Instead of helping "everyone to use Perl", I'll focus more on people who write applications.

Both people who build the applications for a company, and people who build applications
for their own start-up/company.

So far I was following a bottom-up strategy with the Perl Maven site. Building up
the content for people who start from 0 Perl knowledge.
That's where the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/perl-tutorial">Perl Tutorial</a> fits.
While I will want to keep building it, I also need to think about the needs of people
who are further down the learning curve - the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/moo">articles about Moo</a>
already fit that group of readers, but I also need to add a sort-of top-down approach.
Looking at applications and then writing how to build and market those applications.

Oh yes, I guess if I really want to help people build their own Perl-based products and
companies, then I'll need to help them with the business side as well.
That will be even harder than writing the application as I don't have a lot of experience
in that field. I will have to follow a "teach as you learn" approach.
Which is actually not bad. 

I think this is going to be enough "mid-year resolution" for the next 6 month...
