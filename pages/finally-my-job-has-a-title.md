For a long time I have been suffering at many companies. I was brought in to do some 
development work and quickly I found myself doing sysadmin work or improving processes 
in the company. People kept asking me what am I doing but I did not have a name.

Finally I read an article explaining 
<a href="http://dev-spout.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-devops.html">what is DevOps</a> and I 
think this describes quite well what my problem was at these companies and what the solution might be.

At least it now has a name.

(BTW I found that link while reading the <a href="http://devopsweekly.com/">DevOps Weekly</a> of 
<a href="http://morethanseven.net/">Gareth Rushgrove</a>. You might be interested in that newsletter.)


<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>

In short DevOps means the <b>cooperation of development and operations</b> for the 
improvement of the whole company.

Usually developers care about new features while operations care about stability.

That creates a tension and if management does not solve this tension it costs a lot to the company.

<b>The solution</b> - in short and you really need to read the article to go deeper - is both technical and human.

The human part is having the Developers and the Operations talk to each other. Have them in a 
room and even appointing people - called DevOps - to bridge any gap.

The technical part is mostly automation. Automation of testing. Automation of deployment of provisoning and of rollback.

I know I can handle the technical part - I can automate any part of the system using Perl quite easily - 
but I have hard time handling the human part. That requires more management buy-in and I think my fees aren't 
high enough for management to listen to me.

I might need to cooperate with some "organizational consulting firm" to provide a package deal. 
They tell the client how to get cooperation between developers and operators. I help them implementing the automation part.

What do you think?

How do you handle similar situations?
