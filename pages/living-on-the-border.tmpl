I think it is new that Google provides maps in Israel.
So here is 
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Modiin&sll=47.384741,13.4627&sspn=0.205023,0.596695&ie=UTF8&ll=31.88849,35.017118&spn=0.032139,0.074587&z=14">Modiin</a>,
the city where I live. As you can see most of it is about 2cm to the left from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements">1949 Armistice Agreements Line</a>
while one neighborhood (formerly a separate community called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabim">Maccabim</a> is on No Man's Land.
<p>
The other side is what Jordan occupied in the 1948-49 war. 
Today that is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank">West Bank</a>
(not to be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States">West Coast</a>!)
also known in Biblical times as Judea and Samaria, 
that Israel has taken from Jordan in 1967. Since then the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian">Palestinians</a> want that to be 
part of their country.
