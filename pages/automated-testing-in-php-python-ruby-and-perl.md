For almost a year I have not dealt with my Open Source Test Automation
research I started with this article: <a href="/quality-assurance-and-automated-testing-in-open-source-software.html">Quality Assurance and Automated Testing in Open Source Software</a>

Today I have decided I'll try to give another push to this project.
At this point what mostly interests me is how projects written in <a href="/php.html">PHP</a>,
Python and Ruby are testing them self. Actually I should also look
at projects written in Perl but I know at least those living on
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. Maybe I should look at other
projects that are not on CPAN.

The questions I am asking myself are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Do they have unit tests?</li>
<li>Do they have automated tests for larger chunks of the application?</li>
<li>Do they use something like <a href="http://www.testanything.org/">TAP</a>?</li>
<li>Do they use other languages in their testing or only the one used in development?</li>
</ul>
