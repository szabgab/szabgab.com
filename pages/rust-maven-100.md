=tags blogs, Rust



Recently I added the total number of articles to the [archive of Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/archive) and so today I noticed that I've just published the
100th article on the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) site.

OK, it is a tiny cheating as I can see the list also includes the [about page](https://rust.code-maven.com/about) and the page to
[subscribe to the Rust Maven newsletter](https://rust.code-maven.com/subscribe).



The first post on the Rust Maven site is dated 2023-08-27, slightly more than 4 months ago.

| month     | count |
| --------- | ----- |
| August    |  6    |
| September |  6    |
| October   |  9    |
| November  |  17   |
| December  |  52   |
| January   |  10   |


* August only had a few days left when I started to write.
* September - I think I spent most of my time updating the [slide](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/), but I am not really sure.
* October started promising, but when Hamas attacked us and the war broke out I stopped writing on the Rust Maven. (Instead I wrote about [Israel in English](https://israel.szabgab.com/) and in [Hungarian](https://izrael.szabgab.com/).
* November - a month after the war started I switched gears. I felt my posts about Israel don't have much impact and started to channel my energy into Rust.
* December - that was a very productive month in terms of Rust article writings. I published almost every day and many days I published several articles. Some of the articles were only index pages for article series and they probably should not count, but they can be very useful to anyone looking for information about a certain topic.
* January - It is still only 10:00 am on January 4th and I have just published the 10th article. The month and the year starts well.


## Visitor count and subscribers

* The [Rust Maven newsletter](https://rust.code-maven.com/subscribe) has 48 subscribers. Not a lot, but I am hardly promoting it.
* [Rust Maven on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rust_maven/) has 52 followers. Very little compared to other programming related channels, but I am already surprised by the success. Besides I am only getting started.
* I frequently post images of code snippets on the [Rust Programming Language group on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4973032/) where I usually get positive reactions and sometimes suggestions to improve the examples. (there are 21,570 members)
* I also post images of code snippets on the [Rust Programming Language group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/872919370237098). Here too I get quite a lot of positive reactions and some suggestions. (there are 2,703 members)
* My post submissions are usually accepted to [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) that bring a few hundred readers. Awesome!
* I posted on [Rust on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/) a few times. The non-technical posts (e.g. list of [Open Source end-user applications written in Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/18rumat/open_source_enduser_applications_written_in_rust/) and the question about [web frameworks in Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/18ogwtl/which_web_framework_do_you_use_in_rust/) were well received, but it seems the technical post ([Diverging Functions - functions that never return](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/18hagpy/diverging_functions_functions_that_never_return/)) was too beginner-level for the readers there. Someone suggested to post on [LearnRust on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust/), but it is for asking questions and not for posting articles. I guess I should ask them.


Google Analytics tells me that on regular days the site gets about 80 visitors, when [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) is published with links to my articles this jumps to 230, 400, 150 for the 3 days around it. So I guess I can say it brings in roughly `230 + 400 + 150 - 3*80 = 540` extra visitors. Nice.

## Plans

I already shared my [plans](/plans-with-rust) I jut need to keep up the pace.
