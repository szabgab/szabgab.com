I have been contemplating the idea for quite some time, but finally I've decided to extend the Bailador crowdfunding campaign by another month.



Partially because I think as long as the campaign runs I'll have more interest and energy promoting Bailador and the book itself. So this gives me another month doing so. (And Indiegogo allows a one-time extenstion up to 60 days total campaign length.)

More relevant to you is that I'd like you, who have already backed the campaign to <b>upgrade your Perk. Free of charge.</b>

How would this happen? Easy. If you bring in another supporter or two who back the project with a total of $100 I'll upgrade your Perk to the next level.
For this to happen, go to the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/book">page of the campaign</a> while you are logged in to Indiegogo. Click on "share" and get the link from there. Use that link to invite more people to support the campaign. Indiegogo will let me know how much each person brought in.

e.g.
If you paid $25 you'll get either the $35 or the $50 perk. your choice.
If you paid $35 you'll get the $60 perk.
If you paid $50 you'll get either the $60 or the $100 perk. your choice.
If you paid $60 you'll get the $100 perk as well.

Even if you only backed the project by $5, if then you bring more people who contribute at least $100, you will be upgraded to the $25 perk. Meaning you'll get the book in December.

Even if you have not backed the campaign yet, you can donate $5 now and then bring a few additional people in. If those people donate at east $100 in total, you are eligible for the upgrade.

So go ahead. Tell people why did you support the campaign and why do you think it is would be a  good idea for them to support as well.
