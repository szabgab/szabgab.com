Next week, on 26th July, I am going to give a Perl 6 presentation at the 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyweb-il/web/pyweb-il-17">17th meeting of PyWeb Israel</a>. 
That's the monthly meeting of the local Python users group.

There will be a Ruby on Rails presentation before mine and Python + Javascript presentation after it.
It's going to be interesting and now I need to invest a lot of time and energy in preparing a new talk
that might fit this audience.


In the meantime watch some <a href="/perl6.html">Perl 6 screencasts</a> I prepared.
