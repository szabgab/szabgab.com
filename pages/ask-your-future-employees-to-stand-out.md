Are you looking for developers? Do you want to do some pre-screening?

Someone just asked me to forward his CV to a company that hosted PyWeb-IL, our local Python group in Israel.

He said, and I hear the same from many other people, that companies too often don't event reply if you apply through the standard channels.


So I am going to do that soon, but it made me wonder. How could a person stand out in the crowd? Could a company looking for developers publish some directions as how to stand out? Directions that need determination to follow.


For example: We care about python, and specifically we care about these open source packages in Python. If you'd like to increase your chances to get hired by us, us publish a few articles/videos etc. on how to use these packages or contribute to the development of these packages.


I bet I could say the same about Rust as well.

Do you have any such thing in your job posts?
