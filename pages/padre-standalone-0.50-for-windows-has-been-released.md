Soon after <a href="/padre-0.50-released.html">Padre 0.50 released</a> I am happy to let you know that 
<a href="http://csjewell.dreamwidth.org/">Curtis Jewell</a> has built
the new <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/download.html">Padre Standalone 0.50 for Windows</a> that makes it 
easy for Windows user to start using Padre regardless of what version of Perl are they using on their computer.

While Padre Standalone contains a version of Strawberry Perl inside it should not interfere
with the perl you already have installed on your system.
