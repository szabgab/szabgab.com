<h2>Perl Jobs</h2>

The poll <a href="http://perlide.org/polls/the-most-important-features-of-an-employer-or-job-opportunity/">What are the most important 
features of an employer or a job opportunity for you?</a> has ended. Results and raw data are available.

<h2>LinkedIn</h2>

An update to the "<a href="/business-awareness-of-perl-developers.html">Business awareness of Perl developers</a>" blog:

I checked the size of the various groups again after 2 weeks:

 .NET       37,586 => 38,560 (growth: 974   2.5%)
 Java       33,080 => 33,984 (growth: 904   2.7%)
 PHP        16,609 => 16,890 (growth: 281   1.7%)
 Python      9,538 =>  9,690 (growth: 152   1.5%)
 Javascript  8,506 =>  8,664 (growth: 158   1.8%)
 Ruby        8,412 =>  8,602 (growth: 190   2.2%)
 Perl        3,891 =>  4,050 (growth: 159   4.0%)

I can imagine a title: <b>The growth rate of Perl Mongers is double that of PHP, Python and Ruby combined!</b>
(4.0% compared to 1.8%) after all that's all just statistics.... but some people would think this is important.

Well, it is, so this is the link to sign up to the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=40830">Perl Mongers</a>
group on LinkedIn.

<h2>Visitor count</h2>

In "<a href="/falling-number-of-visitors.html">Falling number of visitors?</a>" I quoted a few numbers about visitors count. Since then I have been blogging every day and
got an average of 300 visitors every day. Now I only need to increase the interest level of my blogs.

Really I should ask you! What would you like to read about?
