The number after each technology is the relative search interest in them.

I don't know how reliable is this data. I checked earlier months as well:

In July 2013 suddenly the <b>D</b> programming language appeared at position 12 with a
relative interest of 26. Next month it went down to position 15 with interest level 19,
and then it disappeared again. As the 20th position keep having around 12 interest point, I find it strange that a language could jumpt to interest leve 26 in a month.

At the top of the list I see Java and SQL swapping interest level of 80 and 100.
In June 2013 SQL is 100 and Java is 80. A month later, in July 2013, Java had 100 and SQL 81.
That's a 45% relatvie growth for Java compared to SQL, within a month. Very unlikely.

On the other hand, if we look at several months, then the relative search interest in most of the technologies seems to be more-or-less stable.
