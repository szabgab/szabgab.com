While it could have happened earlier I am glad [dist://Padre] v0.26 was finally
released as <a href="http://jquelin.blogspot.com/">Jérôme Quelin</a>
has <a href="http://use.perl.org/~jquelin/journal/38385">announced on use.perl.org</a>.

It was a longer than usual cycle and many parts of the configuration and plug-in API
were broken in the process. There are some bugs we already found with the new version
but I hope in the next few days we'll be able to fix those issues.

With these configuration and API changes we hope to keep the API stable for a 
few months so more people can start using Padre and develop plug-ins for it.

We should also make sure that from now on the transition is as smooth as possible
between API changes.

Thanks for all the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre developers</a> who made this happen and thanks
to Jérôme for releasing it.
