<h2>Overview</h2>

I started to write it on May 1, but then I got too busy with other things. I think this was the theme of all the previous month.
I think I have way too many different things on my plate and that is part of the reason I don't make much progress in any of them.

I have to admit I feel I manage to do a lot less than what I was hoping for. I think partially it is health issues (I feel tired quite a lot)
and partially it might be trying to do too many things at once.

Partially watching too much Netflix.

Partually playing too much Go.

Partially spening a lot of time (I would not say too much) sport. Walking every 2nd day and spending at least half a day hiking every Saturday.

<h2>Personal blog posts</h2>

There were 5 posts on my <a href="https://szabgab.com/blog.html">personal site</a>. I contemplated the issue about
<a href="https://szabgab.com/live-pair-programming.html">live pair programming</a> and the idea of <a href="https://szabgab.com/team-programming.html">team-programming</a>.
There is a lot more I should write about the subject.

<h2>Webinars and Meetups</h2>

This month I had scheduled 2, but only ran 1 <a href="https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/">webinars in Hebrew</a>.
I had to cancel/postpone the other one because only one person showed up and she also left when she saw there are no others.

It seems that the popularity of my 9 am webinars went down. I wonder if it is because of the subjects I choose or because people
started to go back to work from the office so they don't have time in the morning to join a webinar.

For next month I've not scheduled any event in Hebrew.
Instead of that I already have many <a href="https://code-maven.com/live">live pair programming events</a> scheduled.

<h2>Live Pair programming</h2>

Last month it was just a side-note that I had 3 live coding event, but in April I managed to have a few more.
I had 10 events. Some in Perl, some in Python and in TypeScript. Most of them were in English, but there was one in
Spanish as well.

I already have a few <a href="https://code-maven.com/live">live pair programming events</a> scheduled for May as well.


<h2>Spanish lessons</h2>

I keep learning Spanish with <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>.

I had a few <a href="/spanish.html">Spanish</a> lessons via <a href="https://code-maven.com/italki">italki</a>.

<h2>COVID 19</h2>

We had a family gathering and I dared to visit my cousin and her family. Things starting to look more normal now.
