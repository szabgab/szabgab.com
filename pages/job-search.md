I keep wondering what I can do to help people who lost their job or are new to the marker and could not find one yet.

So far the only answer I got was to help them learn new skills and to help them see how recruitment works.
For this I got tremendous help from the guests of the webinars and also from the audience who asked questions and shared their LinkedIn profile for review.



If you are interested, here is the list of all the episodes so far.
Some in <a href="https://he.code-maven.com/job-search">Hebrew</a> some in <a href="https://code-maven.com/job-search">English</a>.

Don't forget you can help others by sharing the links, subscring to the YouTube channels or by clicking "like" on the videos. Those will all tell YouTube to share the video with more people.
