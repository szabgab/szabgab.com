This is the description of the Open Source meetings in Modiin, Israel.
For dates and to RSVP visit <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Modiin-Tech-Talks/">our Meetup page</a>



This is an evening of working together on Open Source projects and learning from each other.

Are you an open source developer who would like to work some of the time with together others?

Are you interested in contributing to an Open Source project, but don't know where to start? We will be glad to help.

<h2>Projects</h2>

0. You are free to bring <b>your own Open Source project</b>, work on it and try to get others to get involved or just get help with various tasks
such as using version control (e.g. Git and GitHub), writing automated tests, setting up continouos integration, setting up a web server. etc.

If you don't currently have a project, or if you'd like to learn how to get involved in an existing open source project we have some ideas for you:

1. <b><a href="http://www.hasadna.org.il/">HaSadna</a></b> is a set of Open Source projects to provide more visibility to various function of the Israeli government.
We can help you get involved in the development of one of the projects. Specifically we have some experience with the <a href="https://www.anyway.co.il/">Anyway</a> project
but we can explore others as well. The projects of HaSadna are written in Python (Some Django, some Flask) with some JavaScript front-end.

Before getting to the programming part, this requires some sysadmin work.

2. The <a href="http://pydigger.com/">PyDigger</a> site (maintained by yours truly) has a list of 36,000 Python projects.
38% of them are on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but are not using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> for Continuous Integration.
Adding a simple unit-test and <b>setting up Travis-CI</b> for these projects is such a low-hanging fruit you'll be able to do a number of these during the evening.
If needed we'll help you get started with Git/GitHub/Travis-CI.

This requires some level of Python knowledge.

Contribution to the PyDigger site itself is also possible.

3. Setting up Travis-CI for other projects in other languages is also welcome.

<h2>Co-learning</h2>

During these meeting we learn about various topics related to software
development by actually doing them. The subject each person learns is
decided by that person or
if the s/he does not have an idea, we have plenty of suggestions.

In the previous meeting we covered subject such as

<ul>
<li>Git</li>
<li>GitHub (including pull-requests)</li>
<li>Continuous Integration with Travis-CI</li>
<li>Linux  (installing on VirtualBox)</li>
<li>Writing tests in Python</li>
<li>Writing tests in PHP</li>
<li>Writing tests in C#</li>
</ul>

If any of these subjects are interesting to you, or if there is some related
subject you'd like to learn and you are ready to invest a few hours in that,
we'd be happy to see you at our meetings.

<h2>Schedule</h2>

For now we plan to meet every second Sunday betwee 18:00-22:00 and if we see the interest growing, we might change it to a weekly meeting.

<h2>Administrative</h2>

You'll need to bring your own computer.

Organized by Gabor Szabo
