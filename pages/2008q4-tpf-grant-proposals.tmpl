<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> has announced the
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposals.html">Grant Proposals</a>
for this quarter.

There are nine proposals, three of them are mine.

One for
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposal_cpanforu.html">CPAN::Forum development</a>
and two for Padre:
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposal_integrat.html">Integrating Padre with Parrot and Rakudo</a>
and <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposal_perl_deb.html">Perl debugger integration in Padre</a>.

In a few weeks the people at TPF will decide which requests is approved and which is not. For their decision
they rely partially on comments people leave on the TPF web site.

So I'd like to encourage you to read the proposals and comment on them. Write down if you think
they should receive a grant or what are your reservations with the project.
Not only will this help in the decision making but it can also help to improve the projects themselves.

You might even think about a project of your own for what you might ask for a grant next quarter.
