As I was looking through <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> for modules using the
DB debugger back-end I noticed <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Devel::hdb">Devel::hdb</a>.

It is an awesome project, providing a
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/debugging-perl-with-hdb">web-based debugger front-end for Perl</a>.



I wrote an <a href="http://perlmaven.com/debugging-perl-with-hdb">article</a> but I thought
it deserves more publicity than the average Perl Maven article that reaches "only" the 
two thousand subscribers of the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/perl-maven-newsletter">Perl Maven newsletter</a>.

So I submitted the article to
one of the
<a
href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&discussionID=5791810257101537284&gid=106254&commentID=5791927179205959680&trk=view_disc&fromEmail=&ut=2QeGBRlJvzclY1">Perl
groups on LinkedIN</a> and to <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1npx3w/debugging_perl_in_your_browser_using_hdb/">reddit.com/r/perl/</a>,
which then got resubmitted to <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nqgct/use_your_browser_as_a_graphical_debugger/">reddit.com/r/programming/</a>.

The reaction seems to be good on both subredits, and this brought Clicky for the first time to report
that the daily visitor count of the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven site</a> got over 3,000 / day.

Let's celebrate!
