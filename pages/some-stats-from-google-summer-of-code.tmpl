The Google Summer of Code has a <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011">list of accepted organizations</a>. 
Next to each organization there are a bunch of tags. One can download the all the data as a csv file.

So I looked at the data and grepped it for several keywords.

Here are the results sorted by number of hits.

 python     59
 ' c++'     40
 java,      37
 ' c,'      32
 javascript 32
 php,       24
 perl       17     <---
 linux      14
 sql        11
 ruby        9
 xml         9
 html,       9
 json        4

Counting the word java yields 60 results but that includes javascript as well so
I added a comma after the word and counters java,

There are a lot of URLs in the listing that have php in them.
counting php gives 45 results but apparently about 20 of 
those are URLs. That might also mean something.
