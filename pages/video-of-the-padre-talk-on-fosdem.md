Many of the <a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2010/">videos recorded on FOSDEM</a> 
are already online. Including the <a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2010/lightningtalks/sunday/11-sun-padre.xvid.avi">15 minutes long "lightning" talk about Padre</a>
I gave. There was also the talk of Giuseppe Maxia about <a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2010/lightningtalks/sunday/07-sun-opensourcesoft.xvid.avi">blaming the unknown, 
or a constructive approach to technology</a> which is not a strictly Perl related talk but worth seeing.

There were two other Perl related talks in the distribution mini conference. I hope we'll have the videos available soon.

The slides of the talk are <a href="http://szabgab.com/talks.html#padre-fosdem-2010">here</a> but apparently they don't
work on the latest Firefox so I'll need to fix them.
