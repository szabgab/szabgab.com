I am using Google Alert to get notifications on blogs news about various subjects. Today I got a link to the archive of 
the mailing list of the <a href="http://boston.pm.org/">Boston Perl Mongers</a> where they
discussed a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/boston-pm@mail.pm.org/msg05866.html">presentation and demo of Padre</a>.

I am really happy that people talk about the project but there were two questions asked that often come up. 
Let me address them.

<h2>Is Padre better than vi or emacs?</h2>

I don't think the Padre developers ever hoped to replace either vi or emacs. Those two have a totally
different mind-set than Padre. We hope that Padre will have some advanced features that will make it worth 
to switch to it once in a while or that those features will be stolen and integrated into vi or emacs as 
<a href="http://code-and-hacks.blogspot.com/2009/07/stealing-from-padre-for-vim-part-3.html">already
happened in the past</a>.

We also hope that the vi and emacs user will understand that vi and emacs do not 
fit the mind-set of many people. Especially beginners, people who are used to live in their IDE and 
people who live in a mostly Windows world. If they accept this then they will see that Padre is not
a competition to their tool-set but complementary tool.


<h2>Is Padre better than Eclipse + EPIC?</h2>

Short answer: Not yet, but we are getting there.

Long answer: If you are already familiar with Eclipse then probably it will make more sense
to use EPIC and stick to those two. If you are not yet familiar then Padre will be a better choice
for Perl programming as it is faster and knows more about Perl than EPIC does.

The editing part and the generic feature of Eclipse are still way ahead of Padre but in the Perl specific
features Padre is already head to head with EPIC. In some fields it is still behind but in other fields 
it is <b>already more advanced</b>.

Most importantly, <b>Padre has a much better potential</b> in the Perl world as it is written in 
Perl so every user can also easily improve it or extend it.
