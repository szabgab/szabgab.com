=head1 Help your vendor packaging CPAN modules

People often complain that it is hard to install 
[dist://Catalyst], [dist://Padre] or [dist://Smolder] as they have lots of dependencies.
I agree its hard.

One of the ways to make it super easy is to get your vendor ( Linux distro ? FreeBSD ? Strawberry Perl ?)
to package it. 

I have written about this earlier in <a href="/i-hate--net-ssh-perl.html">I hate Net::SSH::Perl</a> and on use.perl.org when writing about
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/38814">Distribution channels</a> and earlier too.
Once I put together some ideas at at [dist://CPAN::Porters] regarding this. Its a bit old. 
Someone could update it.

In the meantime in the last week or so there were a number of posts discussing related issues:

Several posts about <a href="http://jquelin.blogspot.com/search/label/cpan2dist">cpan2dist</a> and about <a href="http://jquelin.blogspot.com/search/label/cpan2pkg">cpan2pkg</a> by Jerome Quelin.


There is also the <a href="http://lists.dave.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/cpanrpm">cpanrpm</a> mailing list maintained 
by <a href="http://use.perl.org/~davorg/journal/37223">Dave Cross</a> 
that should be a good place to discuss how to make downstream packaging of 
CPAN modules easier (despite its name referring to rpm only)


There seem to be some momentum. So if you need a module on Linux distribution and 
have some free time to contribute to the community it would be a great help
if you stepped in and packaged that module for the specific operating system.
