More than a month ago I wrote about <a href="/the-corporate-cpan.html">The Corporate CPAN</a> and posted the question
also on the CPAN.pm developer list. I got a few responses that are still waiting in my
inbox to act on. I don't see that I'll have the tuits for that any time soon
so I better share with you the answers as they were. 

Ricardo SIGNES also mentioned he is working on some internal system with HDP
but did not point to any publicly available code.

Andreas J. Koenig pointed me to the doc/README file of the
<a href="http://github.com/andk/pause/">PAUSE source code</a> on Github. 
We could look around there but he does not plan to release it to CPAN.

brian d foy pointed me to his work on MyCPAN. See [dist://MyCPAN::App::DPAN] and
[dist://MyCPAN::Indexer].


I know it's not much of an analysis on my side but at least now I can file the 
messages in another folder...
