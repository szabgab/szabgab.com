If you are unsure if any of my [corporate training courses](/training) would be a good fit for you or if you'd like to see how I explain things, I provide plenty of freely accessible material.

## Articles

I like writing examples and explaining how to implement things in various languages and various technologies. I publish most of these articles on the <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> web-site. You'll find there plenty of articles both about the subjects I teach now and about other languages and technologies I used.

## Videos in English

* Follow my [YouTube channel in English](https://code-maven.com/youtube)!

Earlier recordings of many of my courses are also available on-line, free of charge. Some of the course are fully available, in other cases only some of the videos are listed.
All the pages are hosted on the [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) web site.

## Meetups

I organized "meetups" long before the company "Meetup" was established.

Throughout the years I have organized many Meetup events with presentations and sometimes with hands-on assignments. During the covid pandemic I had a number of on-line Meetups, but now that in-person meetings are also an option I have returned to organizing those as well.

The topics are quite diverse. In some case we only have presentations, in other cases we'll have hands-on workshops. Let me list a few of the topic in no particular order:

* Python
* Rust
* Go
* JavaScript / NodeJS
* Testing / test automation
* Pair-programming - Mob-programming
* XP (Extreme Programming) practices
* Git
* GitHub
* GitLab
* Docker
