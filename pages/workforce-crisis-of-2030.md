I just watched [The workforce crisis of 2030](https://www.ted.com/talks/rainer_strack_the_workforce_crisis_of_2030_and_how_to_start_solving_it_now)
by [Rainer Strack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainer-strack-1165bb93/) from [BCG - The Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/).
A TED talk from 2014.



* Labor shortage.
* Skill mismatch.
* Cultural challenge.

The prediction is that basically in every one of the 15 largest economies generating about 75% of the world GDP will have labor shortage.
In some only a few percentage, in others 20-30% of workforce will be missing.

In addition the shortage will be much bigger in high-skilled jobs while low skilled jobs might still have a worker surplus.

Robots and automation will just make this gap even bigger.

The solution might be migration and worker relocation. 60% of the 200,000 people asked were willing to relocate.

What are they looking for: Out of 26 items, "Attractive fixed salary" was only number 8.

Top 4 topics are about culture

*  Appreciation for your work.
*  Good relationship with colleagues.
*  Good work-life balance.
*  Good relationship with superior.

In a nutshell: **people are looking for recognition at their job.**

The four tasks ahead of each organization and each country:

* How to forecast supply and demand in workforce.
* How to attract people.
* How to educate and upskill people.
* How to retain great people.


Part of the predictions were about 2020, I would love to know if they came true and if they still think we are on track to the problems
they predicted for 2030 or if that has changed?

## So what does this mean to me, to us?

Assuming I can still work in 2030 and beyond it seems I don't have to worry much about employment, but I will need to be able to
update my knowledge and skills to match what is in demand.

Education and knowledge is key to be employable.
