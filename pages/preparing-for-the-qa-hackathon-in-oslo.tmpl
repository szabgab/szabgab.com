So in less than a week, on the 1st April I am flying to Oslo for the
<a href="http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/Oslo_QA_Hackathon_2008">QA Hackathon</a>
which takes place between 5-7 April.
In addition to the Hackathon, I am also going to teach a training class called
<a href="http://pti.co.il/qa_automation.html">QA Automation using Perl</a> which will
be held between 2-4 April.

Ever since we agreed to this training class with the organizers I have been working on my
materials. I had plenty of plans on how to improve my slides and this seemed like a good
opportunity to implement them. Well, at least some of them.

I have also heard from other Perl trainers but it seems to be true for me as well.
You need to invest about 8 hours of development time in one hour of real training.
I usually don't have such a huge investment up-front but then after every class I
invest more time in improving my slides.

I added at least 2 more chapters this time, clean up a lot of my examples,
added some exercises and I am still not done. Anyway, soon I'll have to
wrap it up.

After the course I am going to join some of the most central people in the
Perl world who create many of the tools I am teaching in my class. There
are many plans. I hope to find some people who will help me work on my pet
projects too.

I'd be glad to work on <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/">CPANTS</a> with
Thomas Klausner as I think it can help a lot improving the general quality of
the Perl modules. Then there is the [dist://CPAN::Porters] issue, especially
collecting the statistics from the various distros can have a good impact on
the ease of use of Perl.

So I am quite excited about the coming week.
