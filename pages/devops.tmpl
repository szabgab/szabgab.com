If your company is looking for DevOps training, here are a few questions I am going to ask:

<ul>
<li>What technologies do you use? (operating systems, programming languages, databases)</li>
<li>What kind of products and services do you have? (Web?, Desktop?, Server on premise of the client? Mobile?)</li>
<li>Do you use any virtualization in the company? What kind of virtualization?</li>
<li>How do you configure your servers today?</li>
<li>How many developers do you have? How many QA people? How many sysadmins?</li>
<li>Do you use any cloud-based services? Which ones? Do you plan using cloud services?</li>
<li>What version control system do you use?</li>
<li>Do you have nightly builds?</li>
<li>How do you test the products/services? (Manual QA? Automated tests?)</li>
<li>How do you release and/or deploy today?</li>
<li>
</ul>
