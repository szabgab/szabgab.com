About a month ago I checked how many recent CPAN uploads had <a
href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2012/12/174-of-cpan-uploads-have-no-license-in-the-meta-files.html">license
information in the META files</a> and how many had
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2013/01/50-of-the-new-cpan-uploads-lack-a-repository-link.html">links
to public version control systems</a> holding the source of those modules.

Today I checked it again.

=abstract end

The numbers are quite similar.

Total checked : 1000

License found: 83.4%, missing 16.6%

Repos found: 49.7%, missing: 50.3%

I wonder if there was no impact because many people did not read these post, or they don't think this is important?
I even posted it on the <a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/module-authors.html">module-authors mailing list</a>.

Maybe if someone else also mentioned this?

In any case, if you'd like to check your modules you can use the example I showed
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/fetching-meta-data-from-meta-cpan">how to fetch META data from Meta CPAN</a>,
that is also distributed in <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/MetaCPAN-Clients">MetaCPAN::Clients</a>.

If you'd like to update them, here are two articles showing how to link to your
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/how-to-add-link-to-version-control-system-of-a-cpan-distributions">version control system</a>
and <a href="http://perlmaven.com/how-to-add-the-license-field-to-meta-files-on-cpan">how to add the license field</a>
to the META files.
