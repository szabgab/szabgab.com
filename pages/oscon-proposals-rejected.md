=head1 OSCON Proposals rejected

All three of my OSCON talk proposals were rejected. I was quite disappointed.
This is not the first time I submitted proposals and I already felt it is
waste of time as it is not likely they will accept. I only submitted as
a friend who was there last year encouraged me telling I am much
better speaker than some of those who were in OSCON.

So its quite discouraging to be rejected again. Anyway as I can see
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/35983">Ovid</a> got similar answers
and he is way better than I am and his mother tongue is English so even that
could not be an obstacle.

So I'll keep attending YAPCs in Europe. I might even visit YAPC::NA thought
it is not likely. I'll see how the training in Oslo next week is going to work
out and if it successful - that both the students like it and I get paid - then
I should try to offer similar classes in other places in Europe as well.
