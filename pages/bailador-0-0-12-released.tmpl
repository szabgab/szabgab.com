People who supported the crowdfunding campaign and picked the "continuous e-book" version have already received the update.
If you have not receive my announcement from Leanpub, check your configuration there.
If you don't have access to the book at all check my original thank-you letter after your contribution in which I've sent you the coupon.
If you can't find it, send me an e-mail.

If you got the "final e-book" perk then, well, you still have to wait some more time I guess, but don't worry, the book is making progress.
