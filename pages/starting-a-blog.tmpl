Permalink using the timestamp?
better yet use some hash like YYYY/MM/DD/timestamp.html

I have been on an off this idea of blogging. I am still not sure. It seems it
needs too much energy.<br />
Two days ago I opened <a href="http://szabgab.livejournal.com/">an account</a>
on <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> but I guess I'd
prefer to keep things on my own site.<br />
I have also been writing on <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a>.
It is probably much more visible, but again, that is not on my site.

There are also other issues here. As usual I am trying to create my own
blog software. After all I don't need much in this. I started by just
writing the HTML code, adding a date and content.
<br />
Then I realized I'll need a way to split up my blog. Hopefully I'll be
able to post often. Then soon the single page blog would not work well.
I shall split up the messages and move them in some permanent location.
The first idea was to to use <code>perl -e 'print time'</code> to generate
a timestamp and use that as the name of the file. (e.g. /blog/1153283015.html)
Assuming I don't write two entries in the same second this is a unique and
growing number. Then I looked at
<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/">Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen</a>.
This reminded me that I also need a title for each entry. Ask is using
/YYYY/MM/DD/the_real_title.html as the name of the file. Oh, yes if I happen
to write a lot then using a single directory might have a problem, having too
many files in it. Besides, the date hierarchy seems like a good idea. Using
the title as the name of the permalink does not seem to be good. At least for
me. I am sure I will need to change some of the titles. If for nothing else to
fix my typos.
