At the next meeting of the <a href="http://perl.org.il/">Israeli Perl Mongers</a> (on February 26, 2014)
I am going to give my first ever presentation about the new <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart Programming language</a>.

In a nutshell Dart is an open source programming language created  by Google with the aim to "replace JavaScript",
both on the server side and the client side.

As none of the browsers include the DartVM by default yet, they provide a compiler that compiles Dart to JavaScript so you
should be able to use your code in modern browsers as well.

Recently I have started to learn about Dart, and even started to create some slides about
<a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/dart-programming/">Dart Programming</a> on the new
<a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/">EduMaven site</a>.

I plan to share what I've learned so far to make it easier for others to get started.
