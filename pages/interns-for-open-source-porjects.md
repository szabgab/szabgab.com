=head1 Interns for Open Source projects

I am just thinking aloud, it is probably just a stupid idea.



You might have already seen that I am trying to get more and more open source projects to start using CI and write more tests.

For this I have also started to build some tools. It is fun to do this in my spare time, but I don't have enough spare time for that.

On the other hand I like to help people learn new things and get in the hi-tech industry with knowledge that is still relatively rare. (e.g. writing test and CI)

So I was thinking of getting an intern who is in his/her university studies to work on this stuff.

<ul>
<li>To go to Open source projects and contribute a GitHub Action configuration.</li>
<li>To write tests for the projects.</li>
<li>To help me build the open source tools that help locating project that need the above (my digger projects).</li>
<ul>

I guess interns would expect to be paid for their time, but I don't really know how to justify paying them. What do I gain from this work?
