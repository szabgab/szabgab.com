After the initial start yesterday morning, I could not stop it and wrote a
small script that would take a pod/html mixed file and generate individual
HTML files to be the permanent files. It also generates a main page with
some of the most recent posts and an <a href="/blog/szabgab.rss">rss feed</a>.

I still need to put links between the individual posts and make the look like
the rest of the site but this is a good start. I should now work on some real
project.
