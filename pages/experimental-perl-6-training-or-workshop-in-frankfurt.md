Details about the Perl 6 training I give in Frankfurt, Germany
on 28th February 2009.



There is less than a week till the 
<a href="http://www.perl-workshop.de/en/2009/index.html">German Perl Workshop</a>
and my <a href="/test-automation-using-perl-training-in-frankfurt-germany.html">Test Automation using Perl Training in Frankfurt, Germany</a> and I am planning what to do on 
the weekend between them.

The plan, as it is being discussed on the 
<a href="http://frankfurt.perlmongers.de/">Frankfurt.pm</a> and 
<a href="http://darmstadt.perlmongers.de/">Darmstadt.pm</a> mailing list 
and also mentioned on the 
<a href="http://board.perl-community.de/thread/13151/#MSG0">German Perl Board</a> is
to spend the weekend learning Perl 6. Not Rakudo or Parrot hacking but to learn
to program in Perl 6.

I have been writing my <a href="/perl6.html">Perl 6 training material</a> so I'd 
be glad to go over those slides. This means we'll learn stuff like

<ul>
<li>Setting up <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> and <a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> to be able to run Perl 6
<li>Setting up <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> with the Perl 6 plug-in so we have a partial IDE for Perl 6
<li>Then we go over the basic use of Perl 6 and how it differs from Perl 5.
<ul><li>Scalars
<li>Basic I/O
<li>Dealing with Files (I/O)
<li>Control Structures (loops, conditionals)
<li>Chained comparison
<li>Lists and Arrays
<li>Hashes
<li>Subroutines, Multi dispatch subroutines, signatures
<li>Junctions</ul>
<li>The more advanced stuff still does not have slides but I might be be able to 
write a few basic ones till then, here are the subjects I'd like to cover:
<ul><li>Regexes, Grammars and Rules
<li>Classes
<li>Meta operators</ul>
</ul>

There are some exercises already prepared that the <i>students</i> can solve 
and I hope I'll be able to help them. A large part of the time will be spent
experimenting Perl 6 programming.

If you are attending the <i>workshop</i> at the end of the two days you
will be able to write applications in Perl 6.

While in most of the cases you'll feel that you can still code in Perl 5 faster than
in Perl 6 - after all you have been using it for many years - there already will
be cases when you prefer to write stuff in Perl 6 as that will save you time
and headache!

This <i>training</i> or <i>workshop</i> is on a cost-sharing basis. We might have
some small expenses (e.g. renting a room in the 
<a href="http://www.club-voltaire.de/mieten/">Voltair Club</a>) that we'll share.

Other than that it has no cost.
