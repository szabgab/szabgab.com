In last several months I spent a lot of time organizing events and trying to promote those events.

Yet I have this horrible feeling of not making enough progress.

I think I was hoping to see more and more people attending the events I organize and more and more people watching the videos
recorded at those events. Yet the numbers don't seem to show this.


When looking at the stats of the [Meetup groups](/meetup) I see a nice increase in the number of registered users, but they are still
far from groups like [PyData Tel Aviv](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-tel-aviv/) or the [Microsoft Reactor in Tel Aviv](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Tel-Aviv/).

The level of attendance is still lower than what I was hoping for. 20-25 people tops.

When looking at the stats of my [YouTube channels](/youtube) I see a slowly increasing number of followers, but no change in the
hours watched. Despite the videos being rather long. Earlier I did not collect these numbers, but Youtube says "about the same as last period"
and when I changed to 1-year view it even said that the watched time decreased by 10% compared to the previous period.

Maybe my expectations were and are too high. Maybe it is only me, who is very impatient.
