Two days ago Adam Kennedy announced the 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/38914">Vertical Metre of Beer 3 - The Padre Plugin Contest!</a>.
While no doubt some of you will have extraordinary ideas, other might want read suggestions.
So let me give a few ideas for Padre Plugins:

<h2>SVK/SVN/Git</h2>

While Adam has written that only new plugins could participate I guess anyone could upload a plugin
called SVNx and implement and SVN plugin even though there is already a hardly functioning SVN plugin
for Padre on CPAN: [dist://Padre::Plugin::SVN]. I'd rather not encourage that so I guess Adam will not
be too angry with me if we allowed the reuse of at least some of the existing plugins. After all, if 
someone turns the current proof-of concept SVN plugin into a really useful one that would be a nice thing.

So while I cannot say anything about the Git plugin but if anyone wants to take over the SVK 
or the SVN plugins just contact me.

<h2>Vi and Emacs</h2>

Aaron Trevena has been working on an Emacs plugin but I think he has not released any of the code yet.
On the other hand there is a half baked Vi plugin I started to write. It would be really nice if someone
could turn it into something that is already usable!

<h2>Code refactoring tool</h2>

I just started to work at a new client and the first thing I had to do is clean up 
a lot of duplicate code with functions that are either identical or almost identical.
It would be a really nice plugin that could help me index a code base, find the functions
with the same name. Check if they are identical or very similar and help eliminate
the duplicate code.

I just posted a note about this on <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=761781">PerlMonks</a>.

<h2>code visualization</h2>

A plugin to visualize a code base using the [dist://Class::Sniff] of Ovid.

<h2>CGI::Application, Titanium, Reaction helper</h2>

There is already a [dist://Padre::Plugin::Catalyst] to help developing Catalyst
based applications. What about one that would help developing an application
using [dist://CGI::Application], [dist://Titanium] or [dist://Reaction] ?

<h2>WebGUI ?</h2>

The same for the WebGUI of <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">Plainblack</a>

<h2>Remote editing via ftp/scp</h2>

Many people need to edit files located on a remote machine. Most of the high-end editors
and IDE-s allow to open a file via ftp/scp.


<h2>Remote execution via telnet/ssh</h2>

When the file is located on a remote server usually we don't even have a local
environment to run the code on. So what about allowing to run the code on 
the remote server via telnet or ssh?

<h2>An integrated solution to record and replay web browsing activity?</h2>

There are several commercial web testing tools that provide a record/replay tool
and then allow you to extend it with Visual Basic. On CPAN there are several really
cool tools to have the extension part and we even have some record/replay tools
but they all need lots of setup and configuration work. 

Most of the companies buy the commercial tools because the nice integration
even though in the end they will only use the record/replay part to kick-start
the testing.

What about writing a plugin that will contain a default setup of these tools 
with possible a few options accessible from the GUI? that way we could get
the attention of the decision makers and have our nice tools used even more.

<h2>Test running/TAP visualization</h2>

Padre can already run your tests but it is only a proof of concept. It just prints
out the TAP as it receives it. It would be very nice if the user could select
which tests to run. If the results were displayed in a nicer way in the GUI etc.

<h2>Plugin written in Perl 6</h2>

I have no idea here. Anything, just write it in Perl 6.

<h2>Just start writing</h2>

I am sure there are tons of way cooler ideas out there that could be implemented
as Plugins of Padre. Go ahead show us the code!
