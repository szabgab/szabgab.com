Yesterday I wrote about tech events with some Perl content <a href="/upcoming-events-for-promoting-perl.html">Perl::Staff - Upcoming events for promoting Perl</a>. This time let me list the upcoming Perl events:

The <a href="http://pghpw.org/">Pittsburgh Perl Workshop 2010</a> will take place between 9-10 October in, well, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

<a href="http://act.osdc.fr/osdc2010fr/">OSDC.fr</a> is not strictly a Perl event but AFAIK it is organized by the French Perl Mongueurs.
It will be on the same dates 9-10 October, in Paris, France.

<a href="http://yapcasia.org/2010/">YAPC::Asia</a> October 14-16 in Tokyo, Japan.

The <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/apw2010/">Austrian Perl Workshop</a> will take place later this year in Vienna, Austria. (no fixed date yet).

<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC Australia</a> will take place between 24-26 November, 2010 in Melbourne.

The <a href="">Russian Perl Workshop</a> between December 18, 2010 in Saint Petersburg, Russia

The London Perl Workshop usually takes place in December. No website yet.

That's it for 2010 as far as I know.
