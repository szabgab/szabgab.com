As I was posting the most recent editon of the [Perl Weekly](https://perlweekly.com/) on [DEV](https://dev.to/) I noticed an article
[Why PHP is Gaining Popularity in 2024: The Unexpected Comeback of a Classic Language](https://dev.to/jenueldev/why-php-is-gaining-popularity-in-2024-the-unexpected-comeback-of-a-classic-language-1pa).

Skimming it I see it gives several explanation why is PHP gaining popularity, but it did not indicate in any way that it really is gaining anything.

I don't have much to do with PHP but I was wondering about it. So I went to the "best" measurement of programming language popularity, the [TIBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).


In their October 2024 report I saw that in the last month PHP 0.69% (whatever that means) with a rating of 1.21% and it is now language number 15 compared to a year ago when it was language number 8.

Not exactly a comeback.


Compared to that Python is number 1 with 21.90% rating and an increase of 7.08%. (It was also number 1 a year ago)

Rust is number 13 (was number 20 a year ago) with 1.45%  and a +0.53% change.

Perl is number 29 with 0.56%.

Anyway, back to my work on the [Python in Israel](https://python.org.il/) and the [Rust in Israel](https://rust.org.il/) sites.
