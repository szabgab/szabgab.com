I just got an e-mail from <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> that I tracked more than 5,000 km with them.

=abstract end

As you might know from my <a href="/reports.html">monthly reports</a> I have been walking quite a lot recently and using
Runkeeper to track my walks. A couple of years ago I was also biking and as I recall there were a few occasions when
I used Runkeeper to log my downhill skiing as well. Sometimes that even included the use of the ski-lift.

So these 5,000 kms are not just walking, but it is still quite a lot.

On the other hand recently I have started to use <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/user.do?id=2721120">Wikiloc</a> to track my hikes and
those are not included even though those tend to be longer than my walks.

I tried to see how much would that be on a map. So I checked on Google maps how much is the waling distance between
Modiin, Israel the city where I live and Budapest, Hungary, the city where I was born.

It offered me a 2,800 km long walk with 18,400 meter elevation gain that would take me 520 hours, or slightly more than
21 days if I walked non-stop.

The route goes through Lebanon because sure one could just walk in to Lebanon from Israel and also leave alive,
but then instead of crossing Syria it took a ferry from Tripoli, Lebanon to Silifke, Turkey and then, surprisingly,
another ferry over the Sea of Marmara.

I like walking and several times I thought I should try the <a href="https://www.israeltrail.net/">Israel National Trail</a>
which is 1,015 km long according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_National_Trail">Wikipedia page</a>.
(The driving distance between the two end-points is 500 km and the straigh line is less than 450 km.)

At a pace of 20 km / day that would take almost 2 months.

Oh and I just found the list of <a href="https://www.teva.org.il/?CategoryID=770">Trail's Angels</a> (in Hebrew). That's
good to have in case I do the hike or at least parts of the hike.

At the end probably I am just dreaming out of my air-conditioned room.
