Don't worry, I'll keep writing for the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site,
but I've also started to build a new site where I am going to publish
material for other <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/">programming languages and technologies</a>.
(edumaven.com was later merged into code-maven.com)

=abstract end

I don't think I'll write lengthy articles there. At least not now.
Instead of that I am going to publish the slides of my exisitng courses,
and the onces I am currently writing.

So some of these pages are only "courses in preparation", or just "notes".

I found the easiest way for me to learn something is to write small snippets of code and
to try to explain it to others. So even if in the end I won't use some of the material for
teaching, creating these examples and slides is useful for me.

So why not share them?

Maybe they can be useful to you too.

I started with <b>Ruby</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>Dart</b>, and <b>Python</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>,
and eveb a few slides about <b>Vim</b>.
I am  going to publish only a few pages at a time, but there is a newsletter where I send out the list
of new articles and there is an Atom feed where you can follow.
