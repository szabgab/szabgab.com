Recently I read a couple of books by Isaac Asimov and I feel the urge to start
building a list of reference he mentioned.

## [Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_(Asimov))

## The Longest Voyage

The Skylark of Space, E. E. (Doc) Smith 1928, the fist science-fictional trip to the stars.

## Inventing a Universe

The "Big Three" Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clark and Isaac Asimov.

Others of importance such as Lester del Rey, Poul Anderson, Fred Pohl, Clifford Simak, Ray Bradbury
and even some who died young: Stanley Weinbaum, Henry Kuttner, and Cyril Kornbluth.

I wrote a series of non-fictional essays for "Fantasy and Science Fiction".

E.E. Smith's Galactic Patrol and its sequels had a multi-intelligence Universe that had its intelligences
encased in radically different physiologies..

## Flying Saucers and Science Fiction

sightings began on June 24, 1947, when Kennet Arnold claime he saw bright disk-shaped objects


## Invasion

an interesting list of earlier events...
HG Wells 1898, The War of the Worlds

## The Science Fiction Blowgun


## The Robot Chronicles

robot = machine + computer

Karel Capek: R.U.R. = Rossum's Universal Robots

Important robot stories of Asimov: "Robbie", "Reason", "Liar!", "Runaround", "Evidence",
"Little Lost Robot", "The Evitable Conflict", "Franchise", "The Last Question",
"The Feeling of Power", "Feminine Intutition", The Bicentennial Man", "The Caves of Steel",
"The Naked Sun", "The Robots of Dawn", "Robots and Empire".
