<p>
Recently I read a couple of books by Isaac Asimov and I feel the urge to start
building a list of reference he mentioned.
</p>

<h2>The Longest Voyage</h2>
<p>
The Skylark of Space, E. E. (Doc) Smith 1928, the fist science-fictional trip to the stars.
</p>

<p>
The "Big Three" Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clark and Isaac Asimov.
<p>
<p>
Others of importance such as Lester del Rey, Poul Anderson, Fred Pohl, Clifford Simak, Ray Bradbury
and even some who died young: Stanley Weinbaum, Henry Kuttner, and Cyril Kornbluth.

<p>
I wrote a series of non-fictional essays for "Fantasy and Science Fiction".

encased in radically different physiologies..
