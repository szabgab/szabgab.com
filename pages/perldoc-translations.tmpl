One of the ways to ease the learning of Perl for those the none English speakers 
is to have translated documentations and tutorials for them. Even if they know
English it is easier if they don't have to learn something in a foreign language.
We already have some of the Perl documentation translated to a few languages but
IMHO they have not received enough attention.

So let me announce the first version of <a href="http://perldoc.org/">perldoc.org</a>.

I'd like to thank Tiago Stock, the owner of that domain who let me use it for 
the advancement of Perl.

My plan is to help the people who would like to have a translated version of the 
Perl documentation available on the web.

Currently there are two sites the <a href="http://fr.perldoc.org/">French</a>
and the <a href="http://it.perldoc.org/">Italian</a> version.

The site is built using the code that John Allen wrote for the previous version of
perldoc.perl.org and released more than half a year ago.

Still many features of the original site are missing but I did not want to wait
more with the announcement. I hope some people will be interested and start to 
improve the code so we can have all the features back soon. The code is now on 
<a href="http://github.com/szabgab/perldoc-org">Github</a>. Please fork it.


The documentations themselves are maintained by other people. I am just using 
the packages released in the POD2::* namespace.
