I am still surprised how powerful <b>inertia</b> really is in personal development. Or whatever this is.

<h2>Separating Perl Maven</h2>

It took me quite some time till I figured out I have to separate the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">technical Perl content</a>
of this site from the general content like this post, and moved the technical content to the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site. Even that separation was not smooth. 
At one point I had 3 separate site, one for <b>Perl 5 Maven</b>, one for a <a href="/perl-maven-competition.html">Perl Maven competition</a> that
never materialized, and <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a>. Then I merged the first two which resulted in quite
some <a href="/three-month-after-domain-name-change.html">traffic loss</a>.


<h2>Edumaven a distraction</h2>

Then, after a while I started to feel that I'd like to publish my course materials. Materials that included Python, Subversion, Git,
and a bunch of other subjects.
I did not want to publish them on the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site for several reasons. One is that having only Perl content on the Perl Maven site might
make better positioned for Perl searches on Google and other search engines. I don't really know this though.

Another reason was that I wanted to be able to compare the sit with other <a href="/the-popularity-of-perl-in-2014.html">Perl related sites</a>.
I don't know if anyone else cares, but this provided me with some way to measure the progress of the site relative to the whole <b>Perl Market</b>.
Thought I think it should be called <b>Market for Perl-related content</b>.

Finally in <a href="/edumaven.html">February 2014</a> I have launched the <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Edumaven site</a>. (Actually originally it
was called anymaven, but after just a few days I switched domains.)

I published quite a lot of slides there, both my Perl courses and several of my other courses. I am still far from finishing the site,
I still have quite some unpublished slides, but I have not managed to attract a <a href="/2014.html">lot of readers there</a>.

Currently I am planning to move the Perl-related slides to the Perl Maven site and the other content to the Code-Maven site. We'll see.

<h2>Code Maven took ages</h2>

While writing for the Perl Maven site I kept thinking that I should probably publish articles about other subjects as well, such as Python and JavaScript.
For the reasons explained above I did not want to publish them on the Perl Maven site, and at this point I thought about the Edumaven site as purely slides.
It took me a lot of time till I realized I should use the already registered code-maven.com domain name and publish the articles there.

Finally at the <a href="/code-maven.html">end of January</a> I have launched the <a href="http://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> site and started
to post there too.

(Even that had a history as, at first, the code-maven domain was used for another project, but let's not go into that now.)


<h2>Next</h2>

That's enough for now. I'll write more about this later. The point, which might not be clear from the above, is that I keep feeling stuck in
some concept and takes me ages till I figure out how to make progress. Something that after the decision seems an obvious step.

The next article on the subject is about <a href="/pro-or-not.html">Pro or not Pro</a>.
