=abstract start

There are lot of blogs out there explaining <b>how to make money with your blog</b> or talking about
<b>content marketing</b>, but now that I am trying to turn the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site
and some of my other on-line assets into a reasonable and sustainable revenue source, I found it important to look
at a few actual sites and try to analyze how do they make money.

In this article I am trying to collect some of the cases I covered.

=abstract end

For each site I also looked up the <a href="http://alexa.com/">Alexa</a> ranking. It can give some indication
about the relative popularity of those sites and you can also compare those
number to <a href="/meaning-of-alexa-rankings.html">real visitor statistics</a>.

<h2>Reddit</h2>

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> is a place to share links and then discuss the conent of the referred content.
It has an Alexa ranking of 33 (!).
It was launched in 2006.

It does not have articles. All the content are links and tons of comments made by users.

They also share some stats on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/about/">about page</a>.

As of October 3, 2014:

174,088,361  unique visitors a month.  6,175,912,111 pageviews (35 pageviews / unique visitors)

In order to generate income they sell <a href="https://www.reddit.com/gold/about/">"gold"</a> which provides some extra service on the site such as 

<ul>
<li>New comment highlighting</li>
<li>Remember what links you've visited across computers</li>
<li>Notifications when you're mentioned in comments.</li>
</ul>

They also offer special deals/discounts on various other sites (I guess affiliate programs?)

The cost of this "gold" is 4 USD  / month  or 30 USD / year.
They allow subscription with recurring payment, and also one-time payment for 1 month, 12 month, 24 month, 36 months.
for 4, 30, 60, 90 USD respectively.

They also provide some space for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/advertising/">advertisement</a> starting

The use Google Adsense to generate income.


<h2>LWN.net</h2>

<a href="http://lwn.net/">LWN.net</a> aims to be the premier news and information source for the free software community.
It has been around since 1997.  It has an Alexa ranking of 47,596.

Basically all the content is free, but some articles are published as "premium content" meaning that non-subscribers
will have to wait a week in order to see them.

Content is generated primarily by 4 people. 

Accoring to their <a href="https://lwn.net/op/FAQ.lwn">FAQ</a> less than 10% of their revenue is from advertising.
The rest is from subscribers.

The subscribers get:

<ul>
<li>Premium content from the moment it is published; non-subscribers must wait a week to access this content.</li>
<li>The ability to turn off advertisements.</li>
<li>Optional receipt of comments and/or comment replies via email.</li>
</ul>

There are several level of subscriptions:
<ul>
<li>$3.50 / month - starving hacker (but can only be paid quarterly) (can see premium content)</li>
<li>$7    / month - professional hacker (can turn off ads)</li>
<li>$14   / month - project leader - premium level can receive e-mail notification on comments.</li>
<li>$50   / month - maniacal supporter, the LWN will buy the person a beer when they meet, they are also credited in their comments on the site.</li>
<li>10% discount if paid for more than 10 months in advance.</li>
</ul>

Everything is described in the <a href="https://lwn.net/op/FAQ.lwn">FAQ</a>.

(The source code of the web-site is not available.)

Originally the site was totally free, but then at one point, du to lack of funds, the editors thought to close the site
and announced it. The response was overwhelming and that's how they reached the idea of subscription services.
A few articles I found related to the change:

<h2>Stack Overflow</h2>

<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> provides a mashup of wiki and forum for questions and answers.
The Stack Overflow site is for programmers but there are other sites run by the same company on the same code-base.

Alexa ranking: 59

They built the platform, the content is generated by the millions of visitors.

As far as I can tell, their primary source of income is companies looking for employees.

This not "open source", but because they are serving technical content for programmers this is very relevant to
my field.

According to <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com">quantcast</a> the site has
about 160,000,000 visits by 50,000,000 people, and 400,000,000 pageviews per month.

the Perl Maven site is similar to them.)
