## Work Experience

### 2018-present

**Guest Lecturer at Weizmann Institute of Science**

* Before I started to teach students in 2018 I taught several courses to the researchers and the internal system team.
* Every semester there is 1, sometimes 2 sessions of the "Programming Bootcamp for Scientists" course.
* At first if was a 5-days long 8 hours a day intensive session before the semester.
* During COVID I recorded the whole content of the [Programming Bootcamp for Scientists](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists)
* Since then the course is back in the class-room. This time 5 half-days before the semester and 5 half-days in the first 5 weeks of the semester.
