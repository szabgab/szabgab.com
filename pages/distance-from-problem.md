How close are you to solving a real-world problem?

How far are you from the natural problem that needs to be solved?

Recently I have been thinking about my work and how close (or how far) it is from helping to solve real problems?



Are you creating a solution to a natural problem or to a problem created by the previous "solution"?

Are you solving a natural problem or a problem created by software?

<li>Are you the one helping an elderly person or providing shelter for someone who needs it?</li>
<li>Are you the one who manages people who provide the direct help?</li>
<li>Are you the one who writes the software that helps person managing the people who provide the real help?</li>
<li>Are you the person who wrote a web framework or a library that helped the software developer to create the application to manage the people who help the elderly?</li>
<li>Are you the person who wrote the tool that helped the people writing the web framework that helped the software developer create the application that helped the manager to manage the people who give the real help?</li>
