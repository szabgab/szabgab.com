=head1 The lack of YouTube viewers

Recently I saw a bit of an uptick in the number of followers in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMaven) but the number of viewers is still very low.

So I was wondering, why do I have so few viewers on my videos and so few subscribers on my YouTube channels?

I started to put together a list of potential reasons. Once I have a list I should try to understand which one can be fixed and which one can have the biggest impact
on the channel.

* Lack of focus? That I have videos on at least 3 languages.
* Thumbnails not very inviting.
* Titles not very inviting.
* Lack of keywords.
* Lack of consistency in publication schedule.
* Content not interesting enough.
* Presentation is not nice (e.g. lack of editing, text size, lack of focusing on the code).
* My accent in English.
