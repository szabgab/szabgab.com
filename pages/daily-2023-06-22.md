I guess instead of calling these posts Daily Report or Daily TODO I can use titles that also have some meaning, right?

## Yesterday

I was rather tired yesterday, probably due to way too much food and excitement the day before.
I mean, it the last 3 years I was working from home and hardly went out. So meeting people, especially strangers, face-to-face takes a toll.
Besides, I am 3 years older. OK, that might be just a lame excuse.

I started to write my own [handbook for OSDC](https://osdc.code-maven.com/handbook) and I had several ideas I wanted to record there
during the day. That's good. I should keep updating it as I think about it.

I update the slides of the [Rust course](https://code-maven.com/slides/rust/) and I recorded two more videos for the [Rust course in Hebrew](https://he.code-maven.com/rust).
I posted it both in the Discord Channel of the the Maakaf community and in the [Israeli Hi-Tech group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/80793/) on LinkedIn.

I did not record the English video.

I was reading the Rust book. Something I started the day before when I was waiting in Tel Aviv.

## Plans for Today

I will continue working on the Rust course, maybe even record a few videos.

I have the last meeting of the [OSDC at Azrieli](https://osdc.code-maven.com/osdc-2023-03-azrieli/). I still have to grade their work but I am glad this one ends.
And I wish I can start a new one improved by the knowledge and experienced I gained here.


### Hebrew spelling

In that Maakaf group I mentioned the language of conversation is Hebrew. While I am fluent speaking Hebrew I hardly spent any time reading and writing. So my spelling is horrible.
A few years ago I used Duolingo to practice the reading and spelling part. It helped me a lot. Both with my spelling and my confidence. Before that I would not even try writing.
However I'd like to practice more. I'll get back to see what's going on in my Duolingo account, but I was thinking of creating a project especially focused on teaching spelling.
So there would be voice reading out aloud a word or a short sentence and then you'd have to type in the word or sentence. It is then verified and the correct answer is shown.

It could be a fun little project that could be then reused for the [Ladino web site](https://kantoniko.com/) as well, but now jumping on that and pausing the Rust course
might not be such a good idea. There is also [LibreLingo](https://librelingo.app/) contributed to once. But in this project I don't think about a full learning course.
At least that's not what what I need.
