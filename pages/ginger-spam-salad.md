While I am looking at my spam folder on Gmail I often see the following
ad:

<a href="http://www.recipesource.com/main-dishes/meat/pork/spam/gingered-salad1.html">Ginger
Spam Salad</a> - Serves 1, refrigerate overnight

and now this too:

<a href="http://www.recipesource.com/main-dishes/meat/pork/spam/00/rec0006.html">Spam Swiss Pie</a> - Bake 45-55 minutes or until eggs are set
