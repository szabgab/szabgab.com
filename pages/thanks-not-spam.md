a few days ago I've received an e-mail from an obfuscated e-mail address. It was strange, but nice.

Subject: thanks (NOT spam)

Greetings,

You don't know me, but I have a bit to thank you for.
That being said, your face (on PerlMaven) reminds me of very hard times - writing my Master Thesis.

Still, it was well worth it and all the information on your website helped a lot.
My project was not related to programming per se, more of an Internet Measurement (32TB of data).

So, thank you for providing the small concise bits of information that aided me in my journey.
Keep it up.

For obvious reasons, it would be useless to reply to this mail.
