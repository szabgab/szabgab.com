=tags Perl, promotion



The <a href="http://pcas.szabgab.com/">Perl Community AdServer</a> is almost
2 years old. It is serving many thousands of one-line messages a day from
the Perl community via the websites of the community. I am looking for more
promotional messages and more places to display these messages.



It is a simple Adserver. Members of the various Perl Monger groups from
around the world and participants of the various Perl projects
can send me on-line text messages (up to 70 characters). These are included
in the list of messages in a simple
<a href="http://pcas.szabgab.com/ads.yml">Yaml file</a> and then are displayed
randomly on various Perl related web sites around the world such as
the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/">PerlMonks</a>,
the <a href="http://kobesearch.cpan.org/">Kobes CPAN search engine</a>,
and the web site of <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/">EPO</a>.
To pick a few.

We even have country-level targeting so for example the messages about the
Lisbon Perl Mongers are only displayed to visitors from Portugal.

If you have a web site, or the archives of a Perl related mailing list
you can add a simple javascript code to your pages and these ads will
start to show up on your site as well.
(See the <a href="http://pcas.szabgab.com/">PCAS</a> website for details).

If you have a Perl Mongers group anywhere in the world, or if you are
organizing a Perl related community event, or if you have a Perl related
web site, or if you have a Perl project you can send me an e-mail to szabgab@gmail.com
or a <a href="http://twitter.com/szabgab/status/4088435817">tweet</a> with a
short text message (up to 70 characters) and I'll include it in the service.

The message can be in any language but if it is not in English, please
also send an English translation. If it is only relevant to certain countries
then please give me the list of countries so I can limit the display coverage.
