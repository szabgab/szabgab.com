After Craft Conf 2017 a couple of us went on a hike in the hills of Budapest. You can see our <a href="/hiking-after-craft-2017.html">plan</a> and <a href="/craft-conf-2017.html">results</a>.

This year I am organizing another hike after <a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft Conf 2018</a>.

If you like nature, nice views, and would like to get away from the city after you've enjoyed the
<a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft Conference</a>, then you are invited to this short hike in
the hills of Budapest.

Date: Saturday  May 12, 2018. from 10:00 till about 14:00.

Assuming the weather permits.



<h2>Arriving</h2>

We leave at 10:00 from the crossing of Nagybányai út and Törökvészi út at the last stop of bus #11
marked as <b>Végállomás Mini ABC</b>. (Same spot as last year.)

You can easily get there from Batthyány tér (square), a major transportation hub in Buda by taking bus #11. 

Another place where you can hop on bus #11 is the Mechwart tér which is on Margit krt. where trams 4 and 6 pass frequently.

The bus leaves ever 10 minutes or so and the ride takes about 20 minutes.  See the map.

<h2>The route</h2>

We will visit the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d-kil%C3%A1t%C3%B3">Árpád kilátó</a> (viewpoint), the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1rmashat%C3%A1rhegyi_rep%C3%BCl%C5%91t%C3%A9r">Hármashatárhegy airport</a>. (So far the same as last year.) Then we take a different route. We go on to <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%B1v%C3%B6sv%C3%B6lgy">Hűvösvölgy</a>. 

From there you can take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyermekvas%C3%BAt">Children's Railway</a> or hike up with us to the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%C3%A1n_K%C3%A1roly-kil%C3%A1t%C3%B3">Haán Károly viewpoint</a>.

After enjoying the spectacular view we walk down to <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C3%A9pjuh%C3%A1szn%C3%A9">Szépjuhászné</a> and hike up to <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos-hegy">János-hegy viewpoint</a>.

At that point you can take the <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapesti_Libeg%C5%91">Libegő</a> downhill, hop on the Children's Railway, or keep walking with us till we arrive to <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normafa">Normafa</a>.

From there we take bus 21 or 21a to <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C3%A9ll_K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n_t%C3%A9r">Széll Kálmán tér</a> a major transportation hub with Metro.

You can take the Metro there though that would mean you miss out <a href="http://www.auguszt.hu/en">Auguszt Cukrászda</a>, one of the best and oldest Patisseries in the city. 

Visiting there will help us topup the calories lost during the hike.

The approximate route can be seen on this map:

The full length of the trip is about 12 km, but there are several places where we cross roads where you can decide to quit and take the public transportation back to full civilization.
(Specifically to <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C3%A9ll_K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n_t%C3%A9r">Széll Kálmán tér</a> a major transportation hub with Metro.)

The places where one can decide to end the hike:
<ul>
<li>After about 4.5 km Hűvösvölgy</li>
<li>After about 8 km at Szépjuhászné</li>
<li>After about 10 km at János-hegy</li>
<li>After about 12 km at Normafa. The end of the hike.</li>
</ul>

So even if you feel it is too much nature for one day, you can join us for part of the hike.

<!--
<h2>Children</h2>
Last year one of the prospective participants asked if she can bring along her child.
I think this year, it would be perfect for children as well, but they might prefer to take the Children's Railway after the first part of the hike.
You'll see how your child handles it.
-->

<h2>What to bring</h2>

Good shoes that you can walk in a lot. Enough battery in your phone to last the trip.
An apple or comparable fruit. One-two liters of water. Binoculars. Some cash.

<h2>Cost</h2>

There are no costs involved except the bus and train tickets you buy for yourself and whatever you spend in the Patisserie...

<h2>RSVP</h2>

It would be important to notify me if you are planning to join us. Send an e-mail to Gábor Szabó szabgab@gmail.com letting me know
if you are coming and how many other guests are you bringing with you. Just so I have an idea how many people to expect.

I'll also send you my mobile number in case you need last minute communication.
