=head1 Rearrange my desk - horizontal screen extension

=abstract start

In my usual setup I use a notebook with a 13" screen and an external monitor that is 24". Up till today the external
monitor was placed above my notebook and I used the notebook for presentations. I am trying to change that.

=abstract end

I tried to hook up a second external monitor, but so far my computer failed to recognize it.

So now I move the notebook to the right and now it is a horizontal extension of my large screen.

I also added an external camera on top of the external screen so it will be in-front of me and not to use
the camera of my notebook which is now on the side.

This probably means that from now on I am going to use my large screen for screen-sharing and the small one for helper
documents.

I guess I need to reduce the mess on the left side of my table and probably get a phone with a better camera in it.
