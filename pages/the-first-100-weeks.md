=timestamp 1372069606
=tags Perl, Perl Weekly



Today I am sending out the 100th edition of the <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly newsletter</a>.

So where are we after 100 weeks?



<h2>Thank you</h2>

First of all let me thank <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca">Yanick Champoux</a>, who took the hat of the editor
for quite a few issue of the newsletter, and <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, who proofread
at least half of the Perl Weekly issues.

Then let me also thank all the subscribers:

There are 4,599 <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">e-mail subscribers</a>, 516 people are following the RSS feed,
752 follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/perlweekly">Perl Weekly via Twitter</a>, 212 liked it on
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/PerlWeekly">Facebook</a>, and somewhere between
3.6K and 4,491 put it in their <a href="https://plus.google.com/102874059713383300948">Google+ circle</a>.

Thank you! All of you!

<h2>Unicode</h2>

I think finally, after 100 weeks, I managed to fix all the Unicode issues :)

<h2>The clever words</h2>

I guess, I should have some clever words here, or at least some statistics about number of posts and the
diversity of readers, but maybe I just leave that to the upcoming second anniversary.

For now, let me tell you how could you help the future of the Perl Weekly. There are several things:

<h2>How can you help the Perl Weekly?</h2>


<h3>Publish more</h3>

If you run a Perl based project, anythin between simple command line tool, through a CPAN module, a major application,
or even a Perl-based product, post about the releases. Not just on your IRC channel. Not even just on your mailing list,
but on a web site. Preferably on the web site of your project, but if it does not have one, then on
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a> or on <a href="http://perlnews.org/">perlnews.org</a>.

Even better, put the official announcement on the web site of the project and then post a short note
to either of those sites linking to the announcement.

Having more content available will make the Perl Weekly also more interesting.

And as a side effect your project might get a few new users and even contributors.

Oh, and while I follow RSS feeds, I don't mind if you pitch an article for inclusion. I am sure you know
how to <a href="/contact.html">find me</a>.

<h2>Recommend the Perl Weekly</h2>

Link to it from your web site, with a plain text link or with one of the <a
href="http://perlweekly.com/promotion.html">banners</a>, Tweet when a new edition is out,
paste the new edition to your Google+ followers, or just stand on the corner of a street
and tell people why they would want to subscribe.


<h2>Sponsor it</h2>

If you run a company, you might want to sponsor one or more issues of the Perl Weekly.
The sponsorship includes a few lines of ad-space for your Perl jobs. See, for example
<a href="http://perlweekly.com/archive/90.html">issue 90</a>


<h2>Support it</h2>

As an individual you might also be ready to support it financially. You can do it via my other
Perl-related site, by registering to the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/pro">Perl Maven Pro</a>.
Not only will you enable me to continue working on the Perl Weekly, but as a bonus you will also
get access to a growing number of articles and later screencasts about Perl and related technologies.
Check out the current list of <a href="http://perlmaven.com/archive?tag=pro">Perl Maven Pro articles</a>.


<h2>Read it</h2>

Oh, yes. I've almost forgotten :), <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">just read it</a>.
