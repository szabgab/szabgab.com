On 13 July 2015, I reported that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gabor529">my YouTube channel</a>
had <a href="http://szabgab.com/youtube-channel-at-100000.html">more than 100,000</a> views.

It seems as if it was yesterday, but in fact it was almost a year ago.

Today the number of subscribers reached 1,000. Another reason to celebrate.

YouTube also reports a total of 183,171 views.


Today there are 273 videos in the channel including 188 of the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course">Beginner Perl Maven video course</a>,
10 <a href="http://perlmaven.com/search/interview">interviews</a>,
8 <a href="http://szabgab.com/perl6.html">videos about Perl 6</a>, 
16 in the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org">SCO cloning project</a>, 
9 on <a href="http://perlmaven.com/testing">Test Automation using Perl</a>
and a few more about Perl 5.


In the past 28 days there were 7,587 views and the estimated minutes watched was 17,140.

Oh and in the last month I've earned a whopping 50 cents a day with my screencasts and interviews.
