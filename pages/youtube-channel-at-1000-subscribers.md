On 13 July 2015, I reported that [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/gabor529)
had [more than 100,000](/youtube-channel-at-100000) views.

It seems as if it was yesterday, but in fact it was almost a year ago.

Today the number of subscribers reached 1,000. Another reason to celebrate.

YouTube also reports a total of 183,171 views.


Today there are 273 videos in the channel including
* 188 of the [Beginner Perl Maven video course](https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course),
* 10 [interviews](https://perlmaven.com/search/interview),
* 8 [videos about Perl 6](/perl6),
* 16 in the [SCO cloning project](https://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org),
* 9 on [Test Automation using Perl](https://perlmaven.com/testing)
and a few more about Perl 5.

In the past 28 days there were 7,587 views and the estimated minutes watched was 17,140.

Oh and in the last month I've earned a whopping 50 cents a day with my screencasts and interviews.
