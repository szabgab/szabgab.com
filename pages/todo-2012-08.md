=head1 Report for July and TODO for August 2012
=timestamp 1343807990
=tags Perl, TODO



July was a busy month. Both the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl 5 Maven</a>,
and the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> sites got a good head-start.
I posted on <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a> while my
<a href="http://szabgab.com/">personal site</a> moved to the back seat.

Looking at the calendar, seeing its a new month fills me with energy.

Besides, today is the one year anniversary of the <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly newsletter</a>.

So what has really happened in the last month?



<h2>Perl 5 Maven</h2>

I set up payment on the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl 5 Maven</a> site, and started
to sell both the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-e-book">Beginner Perl Maven</a>
and the new <a href="http://perlmaven.com/advanced-perl-maven-e-book">Advanced Perl Maven</a> books.

They both went surprisingly well after I announced them.

There were 6 posts in July, but only one of them <a
href="http://perlmaven.com/the-most-important-file-system-tools">The 19 most important file-system tools in Perl 5</a>
was really new. The others were articles I refreshed and moved from szabgab.com. In the next month I'll
need to make a better mix and write a few new articles while updating and moving old ones.

<h2>Perl 6 Maven</h2>

The <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> site is just a month old, but as I already
had the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/perl6-tricks-and-treats-newsletter">Perl 6 tricks and treats mailing list</a>
I could bring in visitors.

There were 8 articles in July. The most visited was the one <a href="http://perlgeek.de/">Moritz Lenz</a> wrote as a
guest post:
<a href="http://perl6maven.com/from-iterative-to-functional-perl6-code">Converting Iterative code to Functional Perl 6 code</a>.
Posting it on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wr5m7/from_iterative_to_functional_perl_6_code/">Reddit</a> brought
more than 1000 visitors, and the usual negative comments from some Reddit users.
I still wonder if it is useful to post something on the programming subredit, or if it is only damaging to the heart.

Actually there was a pair of comments I liked very much:

  ameoba:
    Perl 6 is about as relevant at Common Lisp.

  studentforever:
    Do you mean that for the next 60 years every programming
    language that invents something new will be copying it?

    I think you might be on to something.

I like the attitude of studentforever.

The <a href="http://perl6maven.com/most-popular-shell-commands-using-perl6">Most popular shell commands using Perl</a>
was a response to a Perl 5 challenge brian d foy posted.

The <a href="http://perl6maven.com/how-to-test-perl6-modules">How to test Perl 6 modules and scripts?</a> was in
response to people looking for a <a href="http://szabgab.com/looking-for-a-stable-language.html">stable programming language</a>.

The other 5 articles were refreshed old articles moved from szabgab.com to their new home.


<h2>Perl 6 Tutorial</h2>

I took the slides from my <a href="http://perl6maven.com/perl6-training-course">Perl 6 course</a>
and published them as the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/tutorial/">Perl 6 tutorial</a>.

I have not really announced it yet as I only had time to refresh the first few chapters, but you
can already take a look and comment on it.


<h2>blogs.perl.org</h2>

I wrote 5 entries during July. Three of them were aimed at trying to
get people make more out of their own blogs by measuring number
of visitors and by
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2012/07/how-to-make-your-perl-blog-post-more-personal.html">adding an image to their profile</a>.

Unfortunatelly the visitor counting was shot down by the site admins as that revealed a security issue with the site.
JavaScript is not allowed on blogs.perl.org any more. I hope they'll be able to allow us running some kind of traffic
analyzis.
In the short period I had the visitor counter running I saw about 170 people checking my article
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2012/07/how-many-people-read-your-blog.html">How many people read your blog?</a>
The follow-up:
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2012/07/how-to-set-up-visitor-analyzis-on-blogsperlorg.html">How to set
up visitor analyzis on blogs.perl.org</a> was a lot less popular.

When I posted <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2012/07/almost-a-year-of-perl-news.html">about the Perl
Weekly</a> only 15 people clicked through to the <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a>.

So either I could not encourage people well or almost all the readers of blogs.perl.org are already following
the Perl Weekly.

I certainly would be very interested to know how many people read the articles on blogs.perl.org.

<h2>szabgab.com</h2>

As I moved some of the articles to the Perl Maven sites, the number of visitors on my own personal domain
is in a downward loop. This is ok, expected and even planned. After all I wanted to move the focus the
the Perl Maven sites. It still has more visitor than the Perl Maven sites together but I expect this to change
by the end of August.

<h2>Plans for August</h2>

<a href="/todo-2012-07.html">Last month</a> I did not make any grand plans and it worked out quite well.
It seems it depends more on my availability than my planning.

In August I'll be a bit more busy.

On 3rd August I'll participate at the <a href="http://august.penguin.org.il/">August Penguin</a> (Hebrew),
the local annual Penguin festival, and I'll give a talk <b>Writing Modern Web Applications using Perl</b>.
Which reminds me, I should really finish and practice the talk.

Between 16-23 August I'll be in Germany visiting and giving a talk at <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/ye2012/">YAPC::EU</a>.

This will limit the time I can write articles, but I hope not by much.

By the end of August, I'd like to move all the <b>Perl 6</b> related material from szabgab.com to
<a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> and add a few new articles as well.

As I have a lot more <b>Perl 5</b> related articles on szabgab.com, I won't be able to move all of
them by the end of August. Not even by the end of September.
The plan should be to reach the point where the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl 5 Maven</a>
site has more visitors than szabgab.com by the end of August.

I am also planning on publishing two more e-books on the Perl 5 Maven site. Stay tuned and
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/perl-maven-cookbook">register to the newsletter</a>.
