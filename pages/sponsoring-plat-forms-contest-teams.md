Several other people have already blogged about the 
<a href="http://www.plat-forms.org/">Plat Forms</a> contest
that will take place between 18-19, January, 2011, in NÃ¼rnberg (Germany). 
So far there is one team - the Austria.pm team - sponsored 
by <a href="http://vienna.pm.org/">Vienna.pm</a>. The are planning to use
<a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a>.

As the rules require to have at least 3 teams of the same platform we need
at least 2 more teams to apply and the dead-line is just 3 weeks away.

There is a <a href="http://www.perldancer.org/">Dancer</a> team in formation
but they have not finalized themselves yet.

In order to improve the chances that there are going to be enough teams the
<a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a> is willing to 
provide some modest sponsorship to cover travel costs and accommodation.

If you build a team, please post information about it on the 
<a href="https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/index.cgi?events_2011_plat_forms">TPF wiki page</a>.

Please let <a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">us</a> know if you need expenses to 
be sponsored so we can check our budget or can go to companies to ask for further sponsorship.
