I know some of you will say it was a stupid idea to start writing it. 
This post is not for you.

It is for those who would like to have a cross platform, open source, 
easily extendable editor with integrated pod viewer, 
built-in refactoring tools and graphical debugger written in Perl.

I have started to write one and once it has a minimal set of feature 
I might be able to bribe Adam Kennedy to add it to Chocolate Perl.

So I am going to release the first version really soon but I'd like to 
have a name for it.

So this is a call for ideas on how to call it?

Please post your ideas on 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/36948">use.perl.org</a>,
or on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=698541">PerlMonks</a>
or in your blog
and then send a link to me so I can link from my blog to the ideas.

If your suggestion is chosen I am going to buy you any of the books listed
on <a href="http://books.perl.org">books.perl.org</a> or I can get you a
an entrance ticket to one of the YAPCs or OSDCs.

Perl Polisher? Will it use Polish notation then?
