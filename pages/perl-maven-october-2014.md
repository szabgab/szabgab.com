=abstract start

After a month of school, in October Rosh HaShana arrived and with it lot of vacation days.
This, of course had an impact on my productivity.  So it was a bit surprising to see that I managed to
publish 21 articles, many with screencasts.
It was the second busiest month since I launched the the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site.

Maybe it is less surprising as many of the articles and screencasts were already created at the end of
<a href="/perl-maven-september-2014.html">September</a>.

<h2>Perl Maven Pro</h2>

All the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/pro">Pro</a> screencast were in two series. One of them
is about <a href="http://perlmaven.com/testing">test automation using Perl</a>. 7 screencasts
were in that group. (See that page for the full list of articles and screencasts.)

The other one is a new series. It follows the development of a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a>.
clone using the MetaCPAN API as back-end.

The  <a href="http://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org">introduction screencast and article</a> lists
all the entries published so far. (3 screencasts in October).


<h2>Perl Maven free</h2>

The free section of the Perl Maven site also saw a number of articles, some of them with screencasts.
Check out the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/archive">archive</a> if you are interested in the specifics.

In this month I published 11 free articles and 10 Pro articles. 16 of them included screencasts as well.

<h2>Perl Weekly</h2>

<a href="http://neilb.org/">Neil Bowers</a> became an editor of the Perl Weekly and I made some improvement
in how the newsletter looks like. Mostly by adding avatars of the current editor and of the authors.

<h2>Code::Maven</h2>

In the first week of October I worked quite a bit on the <a href="http://code-maven.com/">Code::Maven</a> project, but then
due to our vacation I have stopped it and when we came back, and I cleared my desk from the back-log I had I turned my attention
to another project that seemed to be a relatively short project.

<h2>search.cpan.org clone</h2>

I've started a new open source project.
A <a href="http://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org">clone of search.cpan.org</a> using
the MetaCPAN API as back-end. I had made <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/10/sco-cloning-project---progress-report.html">great progress</a>
in the code, and I am also trying to follow it with a series of screencasts and articles available to the Perl Maven Pro subscribers.

The site is available at <a href="http://sco.perlmaven.com/">sco.perlmaven.com</a>.


I am not at the point where 80% of the application is done and I should finish the remaining 80%.
It is a bit overwhelming and I think I am going to write about the feelings soon.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

All in all, and taking into account the fact that we spent a week in Hungary and that we had a few more vacation days at home,
I managed to do quite well.
What I noticed is that if I work ahead and prepare a few articles and screencasts ahead - which means I don't feel the pressure that I need
to prepare new ones, I am much more relaxed and much more productive. So it is easier for me to prepare even more articles and screencasts.
