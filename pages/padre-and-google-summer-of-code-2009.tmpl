<a href="http://perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> was 
<a href="http://leto.net/dukeleto.pl/2009/03/tpf-accepted-to-google-summer-of-code-2009.html">
accepted to the Google Summer of Code 2009</a>.

I'd be glad to mentor a student who wanted to work on 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>
in the summer.

The dead-line for student proposal submission is on April 3.

So if you are interested as a student to participate please follow the
instructions 
<a href="http://leto.net/dukeleto.pl/2009/03/tpf-accepted-to-google-summer-of-code-2009.html">here</a>
and let's discuss the project ideas.
