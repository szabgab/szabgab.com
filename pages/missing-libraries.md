=head1 Rust: Missing libraries (crates)

When asked why can't you use Rust at work, one of the answers I get is that some libraries are missing or not mature enough.

I never really know what is the status of the same libraries in the $alternate language the company currently uses.
do they have a mature implementation in the other language? Have they implemented it in-house? Have they bought a non-open source solution?

In other words, I am never sure if this explanation is the real reason they don't use Rust (despite the fact that the person thinks it would
be a good direction), or if it is just an excuse.

## Solution?

However, let's assume that the real problem is the lack of mature implementation for certain needs. What is the solution for that?

The micro-economic solution is for that person to implement the open source libraries that are missing and/or
to help with the development of the already existing but not mature enough libraries. Alternatively the company could sponsor the work on these libraries.

They could also hope that someone else will develop an open source library, but for that the minimum would be for them to describe the solutions they are missing.

This leads us to the macro-economic solution. As more and more people use Rust and as more and more companies use Rust we'll see open source solutions for more problems
and in general will lead to a more mature ecosystem. Some people see this as "this will happen eventually", but behind that there are many individual decisions
to invest more in the improvement of the Rust ecosystem.

As each individual and each company interested using Rust invests more in the Rust ecosystem, the whole pie grows. That investment can be the development
of an open source library or the contribution to such a library. It can helping other people get started with Rust, the preparation of learning materials, etc.
As a company it might be the sponsoring of the [Rust Foundation](https://rustfoundation.org/) or individual Rust developers directly.
