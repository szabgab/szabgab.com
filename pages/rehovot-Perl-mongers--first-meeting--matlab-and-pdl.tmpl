=head1 Rehovot Perl Mongers - First meeting - Matlab and PDL
=timestamp 1257443063
=tags Perl, Israel, Rehovot, Matlab, PDL, Padre

While trying to restart the meetings of the <a href="http://perl.org.il/">Israeli Perl Mongers</a>
I got an offer from Dr Jaime Prilusky, the Head of Bioinformatics in the
<a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/">Weizmann Institute of Science</a> to hold the
meetings in one of their class-rooms. As we used to meet in Tel-Aviv or Ramat Gan and Rehovot is a
bit further away I thought it would be better to split this up and organize 
these meetings under the name <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/">Rehovot Perl Mongers</a>
or in short, Rehovot.pm. I keep looking for a place in Tel Aviv or Ramat Gan for meetings there.

Actually Rehovot.pm was created a long time ago by Jaime but it was sleeping so we are trying to wake it up...

The meeting will take place on <b>Tuesday November 17, 2009 between 18:00-22:00</b>

<h2>Location</h2>

Room 101 in the Levine Building (number 30 on 
<a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/maps/campus3.gif">this map</a> and
on <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/maps/all_campus.pdf">this larger map</a>.
The Weizmann Institute is a few minutes walk from the Rehovot train station, 
shown in the maps.

<h2>Content</h2>

18:00-19:00 


First we will give an overview about <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</a>. 
What is it used for, how is it used, what are its advantages 
and disadvantages compared to other solutions.

Then we will talk about <a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">PDL - the Perl Data Language</a>.

I am sure I'll also show the current state of <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> in 
a few minutes.

19:00-22:00

We'll start to work in pairs or small groups learning to use 
PDL in general and as a replacement of Matlab. We will write example 
scripts and add to the documentation of PDL with a focus on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pdl/index.php?title=PDL_for_Matlab_users">PDL for Matlab users</a>,
a document I started to write a few days ago on the PDL wiki.

The class-room has Windows computers and we hope that we will be able to setup 
PDL there but it would be great if you could bring your notebook.


<h2>Who should attend?</h2>

I think both Matlab users without Perl experience and Perl
programmers without Matlab experience will be able to learn
and to contribute. So both groups are welcome!
Even if you don't have much experience in either of those you
can come and see what are we doing.

<h2>Fee</h2>

Entrance is free of charge.

<h2>RSVP</h2>

If you are planning to come to the meeting please send
<a href="/contact.html">me an e-mail</a> so I'll have a 
rough estimate of the number of people
expected.

<h2>PR</h2>

Please send a message with a link to this blog entry to people in companies
and higher-educational institutes that could be interested.

<h2>Preparations</h2>

If you would like to make some early preparations you could start reading
about <a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">PDL</a> or even install it on your computer
and start playing with it. The folks on the PDL mailing list are quite helpful!

You can sign up to 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> and request to be added as an editor to the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pdl/index.php?title=Main_Page">PDL wiki.</a>

<h2>Contact</h2>

In order to further follow the activity of the group you can sign up
to the newly restarted <a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/Rehovot-pm">mailing list of Rehovot.pm</a>
or the <a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/perl">mailing list of Israel.pm</a> or the
<a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/news">announcement list</a> of all the Perl Monger groups 
in Israel.
