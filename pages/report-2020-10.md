=head1 Gabor self reporting for 2020.10
=timestamp 1604389296
=tags TODO, Report



I am writing this report late, but at least it will be short. Or so I thought. Actually, after going over the things
I did in October it was not that bad as I experienced. It was much less public work than previously, but I had a lot of
other tasks.

This is the report for October 2020. (See also the <a href="/reports.html">list of previous reports</a>).



<h2>Overview</h2>

Most of this month was spent locked down in Israel so I could hardly leave the house.
I was also way too busy by two courses and an ongoing client.
I also had to finish the recording of the <a href="https://code-maven.com/programming-boootcamp-for-scientists">Programming bootcamp for Scientists</a>.

I feel quite tired now. As I also wrote last month:

I definitely need to spend more time away from screens.

I am just not yet sure how will that actually happen.

<h2>Personal blog posts</h2>

There was only a single post on my <a href="https://szabgab.com/blog.html">personal site</a> (compared to 6 in the previous month)
and even that one was just the monthly report.

<h2>LinkedIn</h2>

I hardly posted on the LinkedIn pages but I used the allocated 100 invitations for each one of the pages.
The invitation I used in September partially showed only now showing a bigger increase in followers this month.

I am quite happy with the increase in the number of followers, but I'll have to invest a lot more into sharing
content on these pages so a large part of further increase in followers will come from outside my immediate connections.

Number of followers:

  English: 492 (+63)
  Hebrew:  473 (+70)
  Spanish:  33 (+1)
  Hungarian: 9 (+1)

  Perl:    443 (+79)
  DevOps:  283 (+78)
  Python:  264 (+68)
  Golang:  157 (+39)

  Personal: 4,075 (+28)

<h2>Twitter</h2>

Same as last month, I primarily posted in my two <a href="/twitter.html">main Twitter accounts</a>.

<h2>Facebook</h2>

I keep posting in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/">Perl programmers</a> group
and I like the feedbacks there.

<h2>Patreon</h2>

<ul>
<li>2020.10 ended with 66 Patrons and 6 followers</li>
<li>2020.09 ended with 63 Patrons and 6 followers</li>
<li>2020.08 ended with 54 Patrons and 6 followers.</li>
<li>2020.07 ended with 30 Patrons</li>
</ul>

See a partial <a href="/supporters.html">list of supporters</a>.

I have posted only 9 times in October. Way less than I wanted, but I was busy. Really busy.
I posted a few entries from the <a href="https://code-maven.com/programming-boootcamp-for-scientists">Programming Boootcamp for Scientists</a> series
and I've experimented with some new ideas.

One was to pick a recently release module from CPAN and try to use it based on it synopsis. This went quite well, I'll do more of these.

The other idea was to talk about and write about GitHub Actions and to start configuring it for the various Perl projects on CPAN.
This is under the project name CPAN::Digger.

According to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/szabgab">Patreon page</a> there are now 44 videos, 1 writing and 1 link
available to the Patrons with $5 or more monthly support.

The other posts are public.

<h2>Dev.to</h2>

In October I publish 2 posts on <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab">dev.to</a>.

<h2>Perl Maven</h2>

On the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site there are 5 posts in October, (there were 16 in September)
as you can see in the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/archive">archive</a>.

Several of them are screencasts.

<h2>Code Maven</h2>

On the <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> site there are 13 posts in October as you can see in
the <a href="https://code-maven.com/archive">archive</a> there.

Mostly parts of the course called <a href="https://code-maven.com/programming-boootcamp-for-scientists">Programming bootcamp for Scientists</a>.

<h2>Perl Weekly</h2>

Nothing very exciting on the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> newsletter. I edited 2 of the issues
and <a href="http://www.manwar.org/">manwar</a> edited 2.

<h2>CPAN Digger</h2>

I worked a bit on the idea, but primarily I was still just creating local reports and based on that contacting individuals.
On the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/cpan-digger">CPAN Digger</a> page I try to keep track of the authors I've contacted
in order to include link to their VCS in the META files of their CPAN distributions.

In addition I sent quite a few pull-requests to various CPAN projects to add CI system using GitHub Actions. Some of those
were already merged in, some are still pending.

<h2>YouTube</h2>

I uploaded a number of videos, but they are all also published as pages on my other sites, so I should probably not count them here.
The number of followers on the various <a href="/youtube.html">YouTube channels</a>:

  English:   1,997 (+25)
  Hebrew:       89 (+10)
  Hungarian:     9 (-)
  Spanish:       6 (+1)

<h2>Webinars and Meetups</h2>

In October I had two webinars in Hebrew: One about Web Application Development with Python, MongoDB inside Docker.
The other one was about Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.

<h2>Spanish lessons</h2>

I did not take any <a href="/spanish.html">Spanish</a> lessons via <a href="https://code-maven.com/italki">italki</a> and
I almost completely stopped learning Spanish with <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>.
Instead of that I was learning a bit of Italian on Duolingo. It will probably totally confuse me.

I keep listening to podcasts in Spanish and it seems that in November I'll get back to learn Spanish on Duolingo and maybe even to take classes.

<h2>Hebrew</h2>

I kept improving my typing and spelling skills with Duolingo.

<h2>Hiking</h2>

In October I could only go for one hike because we were in lockdown most of the time.

<h2>TODO</h2>

In November I'll need to put more time in my long-term contract as I did not have enough time in October.
I also have a short Perl course for which I'll need to make preparations. Hopefully the preparations will
help me create videos and posts on LinkedIn as well.

I am definitely planning on keep working on the CPAN::Digger project learning about testing Perl projects and
setting up CI systems for them.

I really hope I'll be able to go for a hike or two.

I have to clean up my inbox that is just getting worse and worse.
