In the last week I have been quite busy with kick-starting the
organization of the conference and the a hackathon next to it.

About the conference I have already written a bit in <a href="/osdc-israel-2009--call-for-organizers.html">OSDC Israel 2009 - Call for organizers</a>,
so let's write about the hackathon.

In April, 2009 I participated in the
<a href="http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/OsloQAWorkshop2008">Oslo QA Hackathon</a>
which was a pretty interesting event. Many of the leading
figures of the Perl QA community gathered for three days in Oslo to
work on some projects.

On the hackathon that will take place in February 2009 in Israel I 
am planning to put people from various languages together. My original
thought was to invite QA people from the Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP and
Javascript communities so they can work out issues with integration.
Wether it is TAP based or not, that's another question.

Then a few suggestions came in to include people from the Java
and .NET world as well. We'll see how do we manage that.

Then came another suggestion that is quite interesting.
Misha Seltzer, one of the local Python developers suggested
to try to work on local - Middle East related - issues.
More specifically to work on Hebrew, Arabic and in general
bidi related testing issues.

I think this is an excellent idea and I hope some of the people
who attend the hackathon will be able to work on those issues as
well.

In Oslo too, we had several topics. Some people were involved in
their own projects while others were going around and chipping in
every place they could.


While on the first two days it seemed very hard to get other
than Perl people to respond, it seems that things started to move.

We already have several international Perl, two PHP people,
some local Pythoners interested and the first Ruby bird has just
landed :-)

I think I go to sleep now.
