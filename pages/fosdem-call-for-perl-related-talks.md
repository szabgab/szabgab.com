=tags Perl, FOSDEM, Belgium

<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> is one of the biggest Free and Open Source 
events held annually in Brussels, Belgium. The expected number of visitors is around 4-5000.

Last year there was a Perl booth and there were a few Perl related talks.
This year we are going to have a Perl devroom where we will be
presenting a number of Perl related talks.
FOSDEM will take place on the 5 - 6th February 2011.
The Perl devroom will be on Sunday 6th February from 09:00 to 17:00..

We're looking for speakers to submit talks for inclusion in the program.

In our conversations with the FOSDEM visitors last year we found
that while many were using Perl or interested in Perl,
almost none of them have ever attended a Perl Workshop or a YAPC.
Hence this is an opportunity to show the latest developments in the
Perl world to a wider audience.

A number of topics that might be interesting:

<ul>
<li>Moose, the Object Oriented system of Perl</li>
<li>Dancer and Mojolicous, the new light-weight web frameworks</li>
<li>New features of Perl (5.10, 5.12, 5.14!)</li>
<li>How to run a new version of Perl on an older system</li>
<li>Testing Perl code and using Perl for automated testing</li>
<li>Writing games in Perl</li>
<li>Using Perl modules without root access</li>
<li>Database access using Perl</li>
<li>Data mining with Perl</li>
<li>Porting legacy Perl to Modern Perl</li>
<li>Perl 6</li>
</ul>

Presenting  a Perl based software such as a
<ul>
<li>Content Management System</li>
<li>Bug tracking software</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

Talks can be 15, 30 or 45 min long including (!) 2-3 minutes
switching time between talks.
