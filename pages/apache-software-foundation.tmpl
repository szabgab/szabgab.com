While the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> project is a diverse and exciting project the 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Software Foundation</a> does not seems to be
very exciting. It has a healthy budget and a number of contributors. It is just working.

<h2>Membership</h2>

The <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html">members</a> of the foundation are people who 
are involved in one the <a href="http://projects.apache.org/">projects</a> of the Apache Foundation.
They are nominated and then accepted (or not) by the existing members.
Currently there are about 260 members.

<h2>Management</h2>

The <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/">Board of Directors</a> consists of 9 people. They are elected by the members annually.
There are also a <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">lot of officers</a>. Each Apache based project has a VP and there 
are more VPs for various general subjects.

<h2>Finances and Funding</h2>

The <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html">sponsorship</a> page tells us that the
levels of sponsorship range from 5K USD (Bronze) to 100K USD (Platinum). 
On the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html">thank you</a> page where the sponsors
are listed we find 3 Platinum sponsors (100K), 2 Gold sponsors (40K), 2 Silver sponsor (20K), and 6 Bronze sponsors (5K).

That adds up to 470K for a year as revenue from the sponsors.

In 2009 the Apache Foundation reported 317K USD revenue.

I am not sure what is the source of the difference between these two numbers but that might be due to 
some of the sponsors on that page joining only in the middle of 2009 or in 2010.

They also reported 236K USD expenses and were left with 343K USD assets at the end of the year.
The expenses were divided more or less equally between 
Infrastructure services (hosting, version control, bug tracking, etc)
on one hand and Marketing and PR on the other.

<h2>Reporting</h2>

The financial reports are a bit out of date on the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/">public records</a>
page and I have not seen a budget or some details on how the money was spent.

There is also the <a href="http://blogs.apache.org/foundation/">ASF blog</a> with a post every week or two.
