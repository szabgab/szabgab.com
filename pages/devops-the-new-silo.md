=head1 DevOps, the new silo

I am not surprised, but a bit sad that many people describe <b>DevOps</b> as the person responsible to make a piece of software run after the developers have developed it.

That's the description of <b>Operations</b>, and even then I'd say "<b>old school operation</b>".



DevOps is the idea that developers and operations people can work together in a single team
and that developers are also responsible for the running of the software (if it is a service).

Unfortunately at most organizations <b>DevOps</b> became just another silo, separate from development.
Sometimes it just replaced the operations, sometimes it is an entire new team making the problem of silos even worse.

I do have my own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-devops/">DevOps Maven</a> page on LinkedIn where I share posts about
"<b>DevOps tools</b>", but I wonder if I should just work my <a href="/linkedin.html">(programming) language-specific pages</a> and keep sharing there advice
that is in the general direction of the DevOps culture. Or maybe I should just do both.
