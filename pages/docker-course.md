Today I've uploded the episodes of the <a href="https://courses.code-maven.com/p/docker">Docker course</a> I already recorded a few months ago. I added it to the Bundles.

I've also updated the text people see when they access a "Pro" page on either on the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a>
site or on the  <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> site to direct them to the courses pages.
