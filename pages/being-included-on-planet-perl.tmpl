So <a href="http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/">brian d foy</a> recently
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/36286">wrote</a> about gaming search
engines by including the phrase <b>perl blog</b> or <b>I like perl programming</b> in the posts on
<a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl.org</a> but actually the fact that
<a href="http://planet.perl.org/">Planet Perl</a> is the first hit in
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for <b>perl blog</b> makes it a good place
to be included.

So I asked the webmaster and within a few hours due to our time differences my blog started
to show up.

Luckily they do filter on Perl related keywords so not all of my posts will show up.
After all mine is <b>not</b> a <i>perl blog</i>.

Of course what brian wrote is that the search engines are crap because everyone does this but
that does not take away from me being happy that my blog is included on Planet Perl.
