Thank you for your support!

The campaign for the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ebook-single-page-application-with-perl-dancer-web/reft/775728/szabgab0926">Single Page Application with Perl Dancer and jQuery</a> has reached its goal, but the campaign has not ended yet.
I've started to write and publish the <a href="https://leanpub.com/dancer-spa/">Dancer SPA eBook</a>, but I am offering a secondary goal to add <b>more content and more value</b> to the book.

Many people suggested to use Angular, React, or Vue instead of jQuery.

I am now offering to add one of them <b>in addition</b> to the jQuery version.

If we reach $7,000 support I'll add one of the above 3 front-end frameworks and you will help me decide which one.
Each supporter will have one vote and I'll go with the winning front-end framework.

So go ahead <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ebook-single-page-application-with-perl-dancer-web/reft/775728/szabgab0926">support the campaign now</a>!
