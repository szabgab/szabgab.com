=head1 Volunteer to an Open Source project with little or no programming background

On one hand there are many people out there who would like to contribute to
open source projects but either don't have much time or feel that their 
knowledge is not enough.

On the other hand we would like to improve the quality of 
<a href="https://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>. 
As it is a desktop project we find it very hard to write automated test.

I think this is an opportunity to let more people be involved in the 
development of Padre by offering them tasks they can do even if
they have little or no programming background.

<a href="http://zenoga.tumblr.com/">Zeno Gartner</a> has started to write 
a number of use cases for Padre that builds up to become a 
check-list of items to be tested.

We need help in writing down similar use cases and to actually 
check Padre according to them before every release.

Each use case will be short, maybe 2-3 minute long so people 
can do one when they have a few minutes spare time. Later
we will need to provide a way for people to report which use-cases
have they checked, on which version of Padre, on what operating system 
and how did it go? Did the test pass or fail?

The <a href="https://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/PreReleaseChecklist">pre-release checklist</a>
already has a few items on it but it needs a lot more items.

So we need people who would like to contribute but don't feel
they have a lot of expertise in writing Perl and/or don't have
a lot of time.

The only thing we ask is some kind of a commitment that you will
help us on a regular base till you tell us otherwise.

If interested, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> directly or all
the Padre developers:

Get on the <a href="https://padre.perlide.org/irc.html?channel=padre">IRC channel</a> 
or <a href="http://mail.perlide.org/mailman/listinfo/padre-dev">mailing list</a> of Padre
and ask around.
