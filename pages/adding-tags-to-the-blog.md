=head1 Adding tags to the blog

=tags tags, blog

I am more and more getting into these tagging business. I am using
<a href="http://del.icio.us/szabgab">del.icio.us</a> to manage my bookmarks
and I should further improve the tags on
<a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/tags/">CPAN::Fourm</a> as well.

So I thought it might be time to add tags to the blog as well and as
I am impulsive in this stuff I added the code to display tags. It really
only took about 40 minutes and half of it was on my train ride from
Tel Aviv to Modiin.
