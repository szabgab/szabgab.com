For the first time in the USA, I am going to teach a shortened version of
my <a href="http://pti.co.il/qa_automation.html">Test automation using Perl</a> course.
It will take place along the other
<a href="https://www.theperlreview.com/cgi-bin/events.cgi">master classes</a> on June 19-20, 2008,
the two days  right after <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2008/">YAPC::NA</a>.

Thanks to <a href="http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/">brian d foy</a>, who organizes these
master classes people can already
<a href="https://www.theperlreview.com/cgi-bin/events.cgi?action=show_form;event_id=test_automation_2008">register</a>.

brian also told me that I should take care of all the promotion so I have already posted
about it on <a href="http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/36397">use.perl.org</a> and I have put a link
about it on <a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/">CPAN::Forum</a>.
Later I think I'll buy some advertisements on Google as well.

To add more to the promotion I should also say that the is a quite a rare opportunity as
AFAIK there is no one else teaching such course and I don't know when am I going to be able to
teach it again in the US. In addition the idea behind the <b>master classes</b> is that
you can learn this stuff at a fraction of the normal cost of the courses. They are given
at such price partially as a promotion to YAPC itself.
