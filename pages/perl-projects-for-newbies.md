=tags Perl, beginners, newbies



One of the best ways to learn a programming language is to 
practice. People new to Perl can either make up a new project 
for themselves or can get involved in an existing open 
source project. So which projects would you recommend for 
newbies? How can they get involved?



I heard a lot about the <a href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/">DreamWidth</a>
development community to be very beginner friendly so I joined them
to learn how are they doing it.

So far I cannot really recommend that for newbies. 
While the people are really very friendly the code base 
they inherited from LiveJournal has all the marks of the 
last 12 years on it. I don't think this is something I'd want 
newbies to see. Maybe in a few months it can be cleaned up.


<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>. 
I would love to see newbies get involved in the development 
of either core Padre or some of the plugins. 
Thanks to some of the other developers in the project the code 
is relatively well organized though there are lots of places for
improvement. People are friendly in the project but I think our 
project does not yet have real facilities to help newbies. 
Also the documentation of wxPerl is very lacking, another thing
that makes it difficult for newbies to get started.
I just asked on our mailing list how to improve the situation
so I hope we will make our project more accessible for beginner
contributors. Also we'll follow up on the ideas listed in
<a href="/improving-the-padre-experience.html">Improving the Padre experience</a>.

What projects could you recommend for newbies?

How can we make more projects accessible to newbies?
