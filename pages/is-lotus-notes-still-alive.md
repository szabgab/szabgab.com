Yesterday I made the mistake and signed up to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/">ZDNet</a> so 
I can comment on an article. I made sure and unchecked all the boxes asking if I want to get 
various newsletters from them and offers from their commercial partners but still I 
started to receive their daily newsletter. I think I already got 3 in the last 18 hours 
which makes their days very short.

Anyway an e-mail junky as I am I flipped through their message and suddenly saw a familiar
name:

<h2>Lotus<h2>

I was surprised. I have not heard it for a long time. I did not know <b>Lotus Notes</b>
is still alive. So I searched for it and found that there is a huge family of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/">Lotus products</a> parked in a corner
of the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> warehouse.

I am not saying it excited me but I had some nostalgic feeling for the good old days
when I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a>.

Anyway, after some time I spent with this I finally clicked through the original article
just to find another <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/photos/lotus-concept-line-up-photos/470655">Lotus</a>.

<h2>Perl</h2>

Frankly I have no idea how does this relate to Perl but I need it in the text so the
<a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">IronMan</a> will pick up the post. 

Or maybe there is an analogy?

<h2>ps</h2>
As apparently there was already at least <a href="http://curiousprogrammer.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/gaming-ironman-perl/">one person</a>
who thought I am gaming the Ironman system with no good reason.
Let me assure you, just as I wrote as a response to the blog, I really had a good reason.
I do think there is an analogy and I think it is important for the Perl community to see this. 

I am sorry if was not clear from the original post.
