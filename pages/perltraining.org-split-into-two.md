Recently I discovered that there is 
<a href="http://www.opensourcexperts.com">another site</a> with many 
Open Source related companies and 
<a href="http://lintraining.com/module/database/">another one</a> which
is "Linux" oriented. Whatever that means.

It is strange I have not seen them earlier, but I guess I have not 
searched for them with the correct terms. Probably I have not searched
at all. I was too focused on just Perl companies and then when I stared 
to broaden the list of technologies I have not looked around.

It should have not surprised me as creating such a directory isn't 
a very original idea. So I got a bit frustrated. Shall I go on with
this directory? Shall I return to the original idea and list only Perl 
courses and only Perl Training companies? Do I really need to invest
energy in this web site? After all I don't think I will make any money
out of it and the service it provides exists in those other sites.
Probably much better that what I can ever offer.

But it is actually fun. I have not been writing in PHP for a long time
and while it is not my favorite language I think I can learn things 
from writing in it now. If nothing else I can learn much better how to
test such sites.

Besides I get in touch with many other trainers while adding them to the
directory. I like this personal contact, even if only via e-mail.

So...

I have been working on the site for some time now again. It has improved a
lot - thought the GUI is still very ugly - but the code behind it has
improved. It is much more maintainable.

As I have started to let companies list course in other open source
technologies as well and not only in Perl, I though it would be better
to have a separate web site for all the courses and keep only the 
Perl related courses on the perltraining.org site.

So I made the code configurable. The default is to show all the companies
and all the courses on the 
Open Source Training Directory (www.ostd.net) while
on perltraining.org show only Perl Training Courses.

(Since then both of those were closed.)
