<p>
Later that day with Sun, I was interviewed for 
the <a href="http://www.zulo.org.il/">Zulo</a> web site.
<br>
It was fun.
</p>
<p>
First of all it took as several weeks to be able to fix the meeting but in 
the end we met in a coffee shop in Tel Aviv. I was asked to bring my own camera
and if possible a stand to have it stable.  As I did not have a stand yet, this 
was a good opportunity to buy one. In any case, <i>if you want to get interviewed,
make sure you bring your own equipment</i>
</p>
<p>
First Yael Talmor (also known as <a href="http://www.vaya.org.il/">VAYA Research Center</a>)
came. She is running the web site from her non-profit organization. Later Meital Bourvine 
joined us who is actually conducting the interviews.
</p>
<p>
Soon it turned out that the place where we met is not good for the interview, it was too
noisy and that we should have a microphone anyway. So we went trying to find a shop
to buy a mic that will fit the camera. We could not find one. Then came the 
suggestion to create a podcast with voice only as it is better than picture with bad
sound. But we could not find a suitable recorder on our computers.<br>
So back to the idea of camera. First Yael tried the camera she brought but soon 
it turned out she does not know how to view the film after she took it so we
switched to my camera...
<br>
You see, it is good to go to an interview prepared...
</p>
<p>
The interview then went well, I personally enjoyed it very much. I hope they are going 
to put it on the web site soon.
<p>
<p>
We talked about Perl, for some reason no one can avoid the question why not Python or
why not PHP (this time I was not directly asked about Ruby on Rails) so we talked about
those too. One of the issues was which language is use more. I mentioned 
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">TIOBE</a> and that it is only one of the measurements.
I can see this month is the first time Python surpassed Perl. 
So there might be a trend after all.
</p>
<p>
I wonder what will the release of 5.10 and more importantly Perl 6 do to this trend?<br>
I guess 5.10 won't make any change (in the popularity trend) while Perl 6 might.

<p>
I also mentioned the small research I have conducted 3 years ago in December 2004.<br>
I fetched the frequency each programming language is mentioned in LinkedIn:<br>
Here are the links: 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/22140">Perl in LinkedIn country wise (December 2004)</a>
and

(frequency of programming languages in LinkedIn)
