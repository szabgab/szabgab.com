One of the problems mentioned in 
<a href="http://www.curmudgeonlysoftware.com/2011/05/23/perl-from-the-outside/">Perl From The Outside</a>
is that many people just don't see Perl.

There is an easy solution to that but one that needs some work.

Sign up to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>, 
<a href="http://serverfault.com/">Serverfault</a> and 
<a href="http://superuser.com/">Superuser</a> 
and look for questions that are either marked with the Perl tag or 
can be solved with Perl.

For example I just saw this post 
<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/302762/how-do-i-write-a-script-that-sums-the-numbers-in-a-file">How do I write a script that sums the numbers in a file?</a>
and answered it. That was a 1 min investment. Including the registration.

What if the few thousand Perl Mongers would each invest a few minutes every day to find questions, 
even older ones and add a Perl based solution?

One could start by searching for tag such as bash, grep, awk, sed, find, regex, 
<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/ack">ack</a>(!) and provide a solution there.

The more ambitious ones would look for questions regarding Linux and Windows and see if 
there is a solution using Perl.

The even more ambitious ones could look for issue tagged with HTML, SQL, Javascript, JQuery, etc.
and see if there is an answer using Perl.

Just sayin'.
