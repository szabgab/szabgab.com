=head1 Poll: What are the most important features of an employer or a job opportunity for you?

Recently I talked to many people about an idea on how to improve
the communication between companies using Perl and the open source
Perl community. On one hand many managers at companies told me the number
one problem they are facing with Perl is that they cannot find good Perl
developers. On the other hand many good Perl developers I know complain
that there are no good Perl jobs on the market.

What is the reason for this contradiction? Is this because the job
opportunities are in different locations than the developers? Is
this because there is a gap in the meaning of "good Perl developer"
and "good Perl job"?

In order to try to understand the problem I created a small poll
trying to figure out what are the expectations of a Perl developer
from an employer or a job opportunity.

In addition to this poll I am also preparing a white paper for companies to
help them understand how they can find more and better Perl developers.
If you are interested in it or you would like your boss to read it,
please <a href="/contact.html">let me know</a>.
