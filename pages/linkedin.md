Besides my [personal profile on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/) I have a number of pages.

Some of them are (human) language specific.

Others are topic specific and they are all in English.

Feel free to follow as many or as few as you feel right.


## By (human) Language

* [English](https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-maven-world/) for the general public with generic content.
* [Hebrew](https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-maven-israel/) primarily for events in Hebrew and/or in Israel.
* [Spanish](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-spanish/about/) - Just playing  with my little Spanish knowledge.
* [Hungarian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-maven-magyar/about/) - it is my mother tongue, but I hardly publish anything.

## By topic

* [DevOps](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-devops/) (Git, Docker, Linux, Kubernetes, Jenkins, CI, CD, Test Automation)
* [Python](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-python/)
* [Golang](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-golang/)
* [Perl](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/perl-maven/)
* [Rust](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/rust-maven/)


The old content of this pages was moved to explain [why is LinkedIn useful to me](/why-is-linkedin-useful).
