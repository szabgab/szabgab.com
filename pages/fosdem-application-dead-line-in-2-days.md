=head1 FOSDEM application dead-line in 2 days!
=timestamp 1258740750
=tags FOSDEM, Perl

As mentioned earlier in ( <a href="/perl-at-fosdem.html">Perl at FOSDEM</a> ) I would like to have some 
interesting Perl content on <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>. I have submitted
a request for a <b>Perl stand</b> and should receive a reply in 10 days but there
are a few other interesting possibilities. Most notably there are talks in the <b>Main track</b>
and there are <b>Lightning talks</b> thought on FOSDEM they take 15 minutes.

The dead-line to submit a proposal to the Main track is on 22 November, in 2 days from now. 
It is time to fill the form if you'd like to talk about your stuff in-front of the FOSDEM attendees.
