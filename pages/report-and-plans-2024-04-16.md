This report was written on April 16, 2024 (See also the <a href="/reports.html">list of previous reports</a>).

## Overview

This is the first report after more than 2 years. I won't detail what happened in all that time. I'll focus on the "recent" things.

I started to learn Rust in June 2023 and posted about it for the first time On July 9, 2023 [Learning Rust - after one month](/learning-rust-after-one-month).
I put together some [plans with Rust](/plans-with-rust), and one thing I wanted to do with this article is to revisit the plans and change direction if necessary.

## Teaching Rust (and Python and git)

I was hoping to be able to teach Rust. I think I am ready, I even recorded several (partial) [Rust courses in Hebrew](https://he.code-maven.com/rust).

I crated the [Rust in Israel](https://rust.org.il/) web site, found several Rust communities in Israel, but most of them are not active.

I gave one presentation at a Rust TLV meetup, but they have not organized more.

I organized two Zoom-base Rust Meetups in November and December 2023 and I've scheduled 2 more for April (in Zoom) and May (in person).

The war that started on October 7, 2023 did not help much either. Although I was rather lucky and noone from my close family got hurt,
but I could hardly focus on the learning and on the work.

Although in the [Rust TLV Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/) there are 948 members, in the other Rust groups there are a lot less.
I could hardly identify [companies in Israel that use Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/companies).

I blogged a log about Rust on the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) site, but still, unless I share a link the regular vistor count is only 20-30/day.
That's no traffic.

## Helping companies move to Rust

This involves teaching and a few months of consulting. As far as I know there are very few local companies that use Rust, but there quite a few that are very good
candidates. I just need to figure out how to get them interested in Rust and how will they know to come to me for help.


## Open source projects - getting small sponsors

I am not too confident that I can get any substantial income for the development and maintenance of Open Source projects. Very few managed to do this
and I doubt I'd be able to create a project that would attract sponsors. I have a number of small Open Source rust projects and there is the
[Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/) and the [PyDigger](https://pydigger.com/) that might be also interesting to continue.
Then there is the [Meet-OS](https://meet-os.com/) project that got stuck back in January.

I spent most of my time trying to improve the Rust Digger and I think it went extremly slowly. Partially because of my lack
of understanding of Rust, but I think I am wasting way too much time on "politics" and on the social networks.

## Meet-OS

Basically and open source project where there can be clients - eg. companies wanting to find employees.


## Personal blog posts

I replace the live web site by a static site on GitHub pages. I use mostly the same code to generate the site that I used to serve it.
This needs more cleanup.

I created a blog about [Israel in English](https://israel.szabgab.com/) and also about [Israel in Hungarian](https://izrael.szabgab.com/).

## LinkedIn

Number of followers:

* Hebrew:   746 625 (+121) - I know I invited many
* English:  557 (-)
* Spanish:  160 (113) - How did this happen?
* Hungarian: 14 (+3)

* Perl:    847 (+41)
* Python:  1,032 (+271) - I invited many
* DevOps:  400 (+34)
* Golang:  214 (+3)

* Personal: 4,691  4,289 (+402)

## Twitter

I primarily posted in my two <a href="/twitter.html">main Twitter accounts</a>.

Number of followers:

  szabgab:      2,318 (-98) - Not surprising after I started to post pro-Israeli posts
  PerlWeekly:   2,703 (-99) - Maybe it was just a natural purge
  PerlMaven:      584 (+3)
  RustMaven:       21 (-)

I tried to use the [Rust Maven](https://twitter.com/RustMaven) account to share Rust related posts, but apparently I am not doing well as I hardly have any followers.

## Instagram

A few months ago I started to post on Instagram on the [Rust Maven](https://www.instagram.com/rust_maven/) account. There are now 61 followers. Not a lot of traction
but better than on Twitter.


## Perl Maven

I hardly post anything on [Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/).


## Code Maven

I don't post much on [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) either.

## Rust Maven

The [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) is where I post a lot these days. There are 183 posts so far.

## Perl Weekly

The [Perl Weekly](https://perlweekly.com/) continues to lose followers.

## YouTube

The number of followers on the various [YouTube channels](/youtube):

* English:   3,073 (+663)
* Hebrew:      512 (+70)
* Spanish:      20 (+3)
* Hungarian:    15 (+2)

## Webinars and Meetups

Two Rust meetings are scheduled [Code Mavens](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/).

## Sport

In the summer of 2022 I started playing Squash after some 15 years break. I have been play 2-3 times a week.
I got actually a bit better.

## Hiking

For a long time I hardly did any hiking.

## Plans

### Local

* Organize Meetups in Israel: both in-person and in Zoom.
* Find more companies in Isael that use Rust.
* Build the local community.
* Longer term plan: have a Rust conference in Israel in February-April 2025.
* Keep recording the video course in Hebrew and keep sharing it via LinkedIn.
* Mention Rust in my LinkedIn posts both on my personal profile and on the Hebrew LinkedIn group.

### International

* Keep working on the [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/) project.
* Keep posting in LinekedIn and Facebook Rust groups and when possible also on Reddit.
* Make sure to be included the in [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)

* Work on Meet-OS and start organizing events on that platform.

### General

I need to find better ways to measure my progress so I won't feel constantly that I don't make progress.
