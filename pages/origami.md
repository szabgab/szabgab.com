The doctor told me I should do something else and not sit in front of the computer all the time.

I told the doctor that my hobby is learning new things and contributing to open source code. The doctor was not impressed.

Hiking and walking outside is a much better alternative, but with 38C and sometimes 80% humidity during the day I can't be
outside too much.

So I though I try to pick-up Origami.



Of course where can you learn Origami - from YouTube videos and web site like these:

<a href="https://www.origamiway.com/">Origami Way</a>

<a href="http://www.origami-instructions.com/">Origami Instructions</a>

<a href="https://origami.guide/instructions/easy-origami/">Easy Origami from the Origami Guide</a>

However these are still on-line. I might be folding papers, but I am still in-front of my computer or my phone.

Maybe I need to buy a book made out of paper to learn Origami from that.


However looking at those site I could not help, but got frustrated by the tons of very distracting ads.
That brought me to the thoughts outlined in the <a href="/ad-free-browsing.html">ad-free browsing</a> post.
Nothing new there I guess.
