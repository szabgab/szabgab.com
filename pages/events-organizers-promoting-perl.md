As promised yesterday there is now a mailing list for people who are interested in organizing Perl
related content to other technical events. The idea is based on what people in Debian are doing and
a suggestion that came from <a href="http://use.perl.org/~sjn/journal/">Salve J. Nilsen</a> 
from <a href="http://oslo.pm.org/">Oslo.pm</a>.

We will list a bunch of events all over the world where we think it is important to show the
powers of Perl or Perl based projects. It can be an event QA showing 
<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> or <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a>.
It can be an event for web development where we can show <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> or 
<a href="http://plackperl.org/">Plack/PSGI</a>. It can also be an event for System administrators
where we can show tons of other things.

To subscribe to the list please send a message to events-subscribe@lists.perlfoundation.org .

Once you are registered you can send messages to events@lists.perlfoundation.org .

The list has a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/events@lists.perlfoundation.org/">public archive</a>.

In the coming days I'd like to make a list of potential conferences and events to attend so we can ask TPF
for an appropriate budget to cover our expenses. Please also tell about this list to the various projects
that might be interested in showing themselves.

We also need to act quickly as during the coming holidays we won't be able to organize much and 
the FOSDEM - the first conference we are going to represent Perl in such a manner is less than 2 months away.
