=head1 Programming language popularity - Stack Overflow
=timestamp 1492803906
=tags Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP



There are many ways to compare the popularity of programming languages.
None of them is perfect.

Let's look at one of those imperfect comparisions: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags">Tags on StackOverflow</a>



That page shows the number of questions asked marked with the specific tags.

Our assumption is that the language with the more questions is more popular.

The limitations are:
<ul>
<li>It is a total since the establishment of StackOverflow on September 15, 2008. Languages released since then had less time to accumulate questions.</li>
<li>On the other hand it does not include questions that were asked (somewhere) before StackOverflow opened.</li>
<li>Some languages might have other resources where people can ask questions.</li>
<li>It's a total number. Does not show trends. A language might be rapidly fading but still have a high number because of questions asked 5 years ago.</li>
<li>Languages with better documentation, where these types of questions are answered might generate less questions.</li>
<li>Some languages are used by less Internet-savy developers. (e.g. COBOL?)</li>
<li>Some languages are used in environments where Internet use is limited and/or discouraged. (e.g. security-related systems)</li>
<li>Some questions are tagged by the library or framework in use and not the language. (e.g. Ruby On Rails has a lot more tags than Ruby.)</li>
<li>More questions probably also indicate more newbies to the language which mean newer languages might have higher number of questions.</li>
</ul>

BTW I just found <a href="http://sotagtrends.com/">Stack Overflow Tag Trends</a> that can show the trends
both in absolute numbers and in percentage of the total number of question on Stack Overflow.
