<a href="http://www.dmoz.org/">The Open Directory</a> is still one of the sources search engines 
use to decide which hits might be more relevant. I recently looked at it and not only that I could not find 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> listed but I could not find any of the following:

<a href="http://www.strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl for Windows</a>, <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::Europe</a>, <a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org/">Bricolage CMS</a>, 
<a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">PDL - Perl Data Language</a>, <a href="http://sdl.perl.org/">SDL Perl</a> and
<a href="http://search.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/search?search=perl+workshop">perl workshop</a> only gave 2 real hits.

This is such an easy way to contribute to the Perl community. Anyone can pick one or more sub-categories 
within <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Perl/">Computers:Programming:Languages:Perl</a>
or elsewhere, where it might be relevant, apply to become an editor and then start adding these sites.
