As a response to my previous post (<a href="/looking-for-a-perl-related-job.html">Looking for a Perl related job?</a>) one of the
comments pointed at <a href="http://odesk.com/">oDesk</a>. I have seen this
website already but now I took a slightly closer look.

Basically it is a market maker mostly for programmers and sysadmins on one hand
and companies looking to outsource relatively small projects. The 
<a href="http://www.odesk.com/community/oconomy">average payment</a>
is around $10 / hour with "Data Entry" jobs averaging at $4 / hour and "Developer"
jobs averaging at $16 / hour. Clearly this is not a market where I could compete
but I think it is a good service for many people. For example for people who are 
in countries where such fees can provide a relatively good living or for people 
who cannot provide on-site development to their customers.

Anyway, I looked at some of <a href="http://www.odesk.com/trends/">the data they provide</a>
for each programming language. They provide several data points, one of them is the
"New Jobs Perl Month" in each language. I see these data
Perl (45), Python (63), Ruby (85) and separately Rails (80) and I can see a trend.
But then I also see PHP (2,038) which makes the difference between the other 3 
languages almost insignificant.
So let's look at the corporate languages and one can see
.NET (150), Java (291) and J2EE (33) which changes the whole picture.

So I don't think this is an indication for anything beyond the users of oDesk 
though others too might find it interesting.
