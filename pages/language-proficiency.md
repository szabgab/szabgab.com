Language proficiency can be divided into 4 main skills and for each skill there can be several levels.



## Skills

The 4 main skills are:

* listen
* speak
* read
* write


They can further divided into subcategories and they can get more details.
Trying to answer two questions:

* How can we gain such proficiency?
* How can we verify our proficiency? (get feedback)


### listen and understand (vocabulary)

* podcast
* radio stations
* videos (e.g. youtube, netflix)
* real-life person

How to verify?

In the case of a real person it will be evident from the flow of the conversation.

In the other cases having a written version of the same text can help you verify that
you recognized the words. Having a translation to a language you know better can help
verify your understanding.

### speak (vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation)

* For this you will need another person to talk to.

### read and understand

* You need text and the translation.
* This can be done by yourself manually if you have access to the translation to a language you speak better.
* This can be partially automated as well. (DuoLingo, LibreLingo)


### read aloud and pronounce correctly

* For this you need some text and another person to verify your pronunciation.
* There is no good way to automate this.


### write (vocabulary, grammar)

* To some extent this can be practiced and verified with some software. (e.g. Duolingo, LibreLingo)
* for really high quality you will need a real person.
