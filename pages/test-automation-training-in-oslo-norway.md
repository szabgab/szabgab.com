This year the <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009/">Nordic Perl Workshop</a>
will take place between 16-17 April 2009. I proposed two talks there.

After the workshop, between 18-20 April there is going to be a 3 days long
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?oslo_perl_6_hackaton_2009">Perl 6 hackathon</a>
in which I hope to participate.

After that, between 21-24 April 2009, I am going to give the newly
extended version of
<a href="/perl-in-test-automation">Test Automation using Perl</a>
course that is going to be 4 days long.

Both the hackathon and my training is going to take place in the
same place as last year, in the offices of
<a href="http://www.linpro.no/">Linpro</a>
If you are interested in the course, please send me an
email to Gabor Szabo &lt;szabgab@gmail.com&gt; .

<h2>Update</h2>

The dates were slightly changed after it turned out that the hackathon is
3 days long and not 2 days long.
