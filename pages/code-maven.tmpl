=abstract start

For a long time I wanted to extend the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site to include articles
about other subject as well, but I think publishing articles about Python, Ruby or even JavaScirpt on a site called
<b>Perl</b>-something would be strange.

Finally I reached the conclusion that I should use the domain I bought for some other purposes, but that would be perfect for
this.

Hence a few days ago I started to post on the <a href="http://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> site.

=abstract end

As you might see the two sites look quite similar, because I use the same back-end for both of them
and I have not invested in some branded UI yet. That will come too. For now I wanted to get a feeling
of writing about other subjects.

I started writing about Node.js, but my plans include quite a range of subjects. I don't even want to limit
them at this point. I think I'll just write about everything code, or programming related. That will
include a lot of the "web stack": HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Probably I look at Dart again.

I'll certainly will use and write about some of the databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB come to my mind immediately).

Quite likely I am going to write about Python, Ruby and PHP as well. I'll probably exclude Perl, as I'll
keep posting about Perl 5 on the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site, and about Perl 6 on the
<a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a>.
