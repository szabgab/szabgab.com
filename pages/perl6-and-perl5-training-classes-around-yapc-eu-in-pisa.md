=head1 Perl 6 and Perl 5 training classes around YAPC::EU in Pisa
=timestamp 1278636018
=tags Perl, Perl 6, training, YAPC, Pisa

Just a reminder that there are going to be a number of 
<a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/training_courses.html">training courses</a>
on the days before and after YAPC::EU. (2,3 and 7 August).

The detailed list can be found on the web site of YAPC::Europe as linked above.

Trainers include Dave Cross, Dave Rolsky, Matt S. Trout , Herbert Breunung, brian d foy
and myself. In order of appearance. Prices range between 150-220 Euro which are
way lower than the prices these people normally charge when they do 
corporate training. It's a bargain.

<h2>Rakudo * and Perl 6</h2>

My main interest is of course the Perl 6 training I am going to teach.
I want to making sure it gives something that is really interesting and worth the money.

The timing is good as <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo * (a "usable Perl 6")</a>
will be released on July 29, just a few days before YAPC::EU.

There are going to be several Perl 6 related talks in the regular schedule:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2613">Tim Bunce: Database Access in Perl 6 and Parrot</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2729">Jonathan Worthington: Perl 6 Signatures: The Full Story</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2840">Martin Berends: Perl 6 Database Interfacing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2927">Patrick Michaud: Not Quite Perl (NQP) - A lightweight Perl 6</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2928">Patrick Michaud: Rakudo Star - A usable Perl 6 release</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2949">Moritz Lenz: Perl 6 and The Real World</a></li>
</ul>

I'll try to make sure that on one hand people who attended these talk will not get the same 
material twice on the other hand those who don't attend the Perl 6 related talks will not miss anything.
It will be an interesting exercise.

I am also happy that <a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a>, the pumking and lead developer of Rakodo
will also be in the class. As in previous occasions in Oslo and Lisbon I am sure it will be fun.
