In the <a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search">advanced search</a>
Google allows us to specify the language in which we are searching in.
To my surprise there are only 46 or so languages listed.

=abstract end

It is really strange given there are a lot more languages.
As far as I know there are about 6,000 languages.

Even if we only consider the ones that have <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia sites</a>, there
are about <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">300 languages with Wikipedia sites</a>, 71 of these languages have more than 100,000 pages each.

The list of languages Google supports is also not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers">languages with the most speakers</a>.

There are 45 language with more than 40 million speakers, but the list supported by Google is very different from that list.
