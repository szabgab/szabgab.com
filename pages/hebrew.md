I am not up to date on learning Hebrew, I learned it in the early 90's, but I learned [Spanish](/spanish) recently and I put together a page listing the resources.
You might find similar resources for Hebrew as well, though probably a lot less than for Spanish.

In particular I did play a bit with with [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) that has a Hebrew course. I used it to practice my spelling as despite living in Israel for more than
30 years and being fluent speaking the language, I hardly read and wrote in it. The Duolingo course has some really strange sentences, but this is true for them in the other language-courses as well.
Overall it was very useful for me.

I also used [italki](https://www.italki.com/i/EFbbfc) to practice speaking Spanish. If you'd like to practice speaking Hebrew and especially if you are not in Israel,
Italki can help you find a teacher or a partner for conversations. In June 2024 I found 96 Hebrew people, 16 of whom are professional teachers. Most of the people there are native Hebrew speakers.
