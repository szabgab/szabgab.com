The last time I wrote about it was back on 28 July 2016 - almost 4 years ago when
I celebrated <a href="/youtube-channel-at-200000-views.html">200,000 view on my YouTube channel</a>
Then for 4 years I have not done almost anything with the channel.

About half a year ago I recorded and uploaded a bunch of videos in Hebrew, but only recently, about 2 months ago
in the middle of being home-bound due to the Corona virus did I start to pay a bit more attention.

<h2>YouTube and languages</h2>

Soon I realized I should not have mixed my Hebrew-language videos with my <a href="https://code-maven.com/youtube">English-language videos</a>
so I created a separate <a href="https://he.code-maven.com/youtube">channel for Hebrew videos</a> and moved them over.

If I was already there I also created one for <a href="https://hu.code-maven.com/youtube">Hungarian</a> and one for
<a href="https://es.code-maven.com/youtube">Spanish</a> videos. The former is my mother tongue so I should be able to create videos
in it, but I have not discussed anything technology-related in Hungarian for, about never. The latter,
<a href="/spanish.html">Spanish</a> is the language I have been learning for a year and a half. It is a bit
presumptuous that I'll be able to create quality content in Spanish any time soon, but then again, if I start now
I have a better chance to reaching something than if I postpone. Besides, it could be funny to some people
to see me stumble on my own teeth and tongue while trying to record a video.


<h2>The last 2 months or so</h2>

So what happened in the last few weeks?

I've uploaded a number of technical videos and I tried to use my other platforms to get more subscribers.
Specifically, the subscribers of the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site, the subscribers
of the Code-Maven Meetup page were primarily invited to the Hebrew version of the channel.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> was utilized for that.

I've also invited the subscribers of the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly mailing</a> and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl">Perl group on Reddit</a>.


I've also started to run interviews with recruites, HR managers, head hunters to understand their point of view of the recruitment
process and thereby help all the people who would like to find a (new) job in hi-tech. I've started with the
<a href="https://he.code-maven.com/job-search">Hebrew</a> version, but soon it was followed by an <a href="https://code-maven.com/job-search">English</a> version.

I've plenty of more things to do, but for now let's have some statistics here.
