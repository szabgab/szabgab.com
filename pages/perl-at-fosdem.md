=tags Perl, FOSDEM, conferences



<a href="http://martian.org/karen/">Karen Pauley</a> just wrote 
about attending conferences that are 
<a href="http://martian.org/karen/2009/10/14/not-only-perl/">not Perl specific</a>.

I attended a few local non-Perl conferences and even gave talks about 
Perl and Parrot on some of these events but I never did it overseas. 


<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> is taking place every year in 
Brussels, Belgium. The next conference will be 6-7 February 2010 
and I plan to be there.



Apparently this is one of the biggest Open Source conference and as 
I've heard there is hardly any Perl content. So I am interested in 
this conference both for learning what people using other technologies 
talk about and also as an opportunity to promote Perl and projects
written in Perl.

<h2>Conference Format</h2>

As I understand the format of the conference, there are two <b>main tracks</b> 
with 50-minute long talks and two sessions of <b>lightning talks</b> in which 
each talk is 15 minutes long. (Yeah, I know the Perl conference attendees
are used to 5-minute long lightning talks).

In addition there used to be <b>developer rooms</b> which are 
technology or field related tracks. Each subject having a 
single room for the 2 days of the conference full of talks. The
idea of developer rooms is being reworked now, I'll have to see how it
changes.

The 4th thing they have at FOSDEM are the <b>stands</b>. Each project can ask
for a table and two chairs where they can talk to other people and show their stuff. 
This is basically an organized form of the hallway track.

<h2>Plan</h2>

I assume there won't be many Perl programmers so trying to fill a development 
room is probably not a good idea.

My plan is to submit one or two talks to the <b>main track</b> and to 
encourage more Perl developers to submit talks that can be interesting 
for people who are not yet Perl developers. For example I can imagine a Catalyst 
talk and even a Moose talk if targeted well. 


I also hope that there will be a few people who can offer talks in the <b>developer rooms</b> on how Perl is 
solving the particular problem. For example I just saw on the 
<a href="http://lists.fosdem.org/mailman/listinfo/fosdem">FOSDEM mailing list</a>
a suggestion to organize an 
<a href="http://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2009-October/000780.html">ODF developer room</a>.
I hope someone from the perl community will be able to offer a talk about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODF">ODF</a>.

Lastly I'd like to setup a <b>stand for Perl and related projects</b>. For that there should be
about 5-10 people who can be at the stand part of the time talking to other open source
developers. (The organizers ask for two people at any given time at every stand).

Dave Cross has already submitted a talk and volunteered to be there part of that time. 
If you are also interested, please let me know so I can see that there are going to be 
enough people for this.
