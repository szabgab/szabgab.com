=head1 Why 🦀 Rust? It is good for both Microsoft and Linux!

People often ask me why did I start to learn hashtag#Rust? 🦀

After all I have been using and teaching hashtag#Python for many years and hashtag#Python is probably the most popular language. 🐍

I read a lot of good things about the technical aspects of Rust, but there are many other languages with excellent features. Different, but excellent features.

I am personally interested both the technical capabilities of the language and its growth potential and I think the number of Rust programmers will grow a lot in the coming years. 📈

If you are interested in the technical aspect, I can discuss that in another post, but for now let me tell you about the 2 main, non-technical data points.

One is that some of the biggest tech companies support the development of the language and specifically that hashtag#Microsoft has started to use it in a lot of areas.

The other one was that Linus Torvalds has approved hashtag#Rust to be a language to be used in the hashtag#Linux kernel. This is the only language besides hashtag#C (not to be confused with C# 😀 ) that has been approved.

So two very different ecosystems decided that Rust is good for their purposes. I bet it will be good for many other companies as well.

Why did you start to learn Rust or if you have not yet, what is stopping you?
