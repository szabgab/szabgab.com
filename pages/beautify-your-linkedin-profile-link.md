Two unsolicited advice for LinkedIn users:

## Beautify your LinkedIn profile link

Check your the URL of your LinkedIn profile It might be something like this: https://www.linkedin.com/in/foo-bar-b5b37626/
You can change that to some nicer address. For example: https://www.linkedin.com/in/foo-bar/ or https://www.linkedin.com/in/foobar/

See [this answer](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/87) for more details.


## Remove duplicate profiles

Anoth issue that I see here and there is that some people have multiple profiles created when they were invited via different e-mail addresses. I know this happened to me a long time ago.

If you have multiple profiles you can [merge them](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1275).

It find it somewhat strange that the profile address of many people on #LinkedIn is still the same as LinkedIn generated for them including some random number.


OTOH I can understand that as it took me a while to figure out how to change it and there are a lots of other features on LinkedIn I have not used yet.


So in case you'd like to change your address from something like "foo-bar-1212874628764" to a more personal one, I included the instructions bellow.


You can change it to your own name, if it is not taken yet, or you can change it to your nickname, as I did, because my full name was already taken.


* Click on the "Me" in the top right corner of LinkedIn.
* Click on "View Profile"
* Top right you'll see "Public profile & URL" click on the pen next to it.
* Top right you will see "Edit your custom URL"  click on the pen next to it.
* Change the URL of your profile and click "Save".


Once you did this, please comment on this post so we can see your new profile address.

It will make me understand if this post helped you and it will also help reach more people with this message.


Enjoy!
