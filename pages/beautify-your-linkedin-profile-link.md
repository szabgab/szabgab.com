Two unsolicited advice for LinkedIn users:



<h2>Beautify your LinkedIn profile link</h2>

Check your the URL of your LinkedIn profile It might be something like this: https://www.linkedin.com/in/foo-bar-b5b37626/
You can change that to some nicer address. For example: https://www.linkedin.com/in/foo-bar/ or https://www.linkedin.com/in/foobar/ 

See <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/87">this answer</a> for more details.


<h2>Remove duplicate profiles</h2>

Anoth issue that I see here and there is that some people have multiple profiles created when they were invited via different e-mail addresses. I know this happened to me a long time ago.

If you have multiple profiles you can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1275">merge them</a>.
