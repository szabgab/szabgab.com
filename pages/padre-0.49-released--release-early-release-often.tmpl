The mantra of open source is to <b>release early, release often</b>.

In the last two months we are somewhat slow in releases as we had only
4 versions but as Padre is 
getting more mature that was expected.
So the "release often" part got a bit less often but at least I released
this version early. The timestamp was showing 5 am or so.


According to the <a href="http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Padre/Changes">Changes file</a>
version 0.49 of <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>
contains mostly improvements made by
<a href="http://padre-ide.de/">Sebastian Willing</a> (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sewi/">SEWI</a>).
Some work by
<a href="http://ahmadzawawi.blogspot.com/">Ahmad M. Zawawi</a> (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~azawawi">AZAWAWI</a>)

<h2>Availability</h2>

Padre can be installed from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Padre">CPAN</a>, 
but for Windows users an easier and faster way is to install the Stand Alone version 
of Padre which is based on v0.45 and then upgrade from CPAN.
For detailed instructions see the 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/download.html">download page of Padre</a>.
