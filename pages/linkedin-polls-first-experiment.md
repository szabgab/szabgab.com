=head1 LinkedIn polls - first experiment

=tags LinkedIn, polls

=abstract start

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> recently added the possibility to run polls. Immediately everyone around me started to create polls,
but I don't like that type of "gold rush" so I waited.

A few days ago finally I got the idea to try it for the first time.

=abstract end

A ran a poll in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3726537/">DevOps professionals</a> group that has 26,656 members.

In the poll I asked

<b>What would you like to read about? (Add more in comments)</b>

and the options were

<ul>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6691774414301757440/"><img src="/img/first-linkedin-poll.png" alt="LinkedIn poll"></a>

I published it on a Wednesday and I configured the poll to run for 7 days. The first 2 days I got over 200 responses, 5 likes and a single comment. (The other 2 are from me)
On the 3rd day it was already burried by other post so I think people stopped seeing it and stopped voting.

As you can see I did not include a  link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-devops/">DevOps page</a>,
but after 2 days or so I added a comment with a link to the page.

Besides the insight, that the respondents are interested in Kubernetes more than anything else I also got 2-3 followers on
my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-devops/">DevOps</a> and a few people connected with me directly.

In that regard the post was quite unsuccessful as I was hoping for more followers.

<h2>A few ideas for future polls</h2>

Only provide 3 real choices and let the 4th be "Other. Please let know in the comment".

Include a link to my LinkedIn page in the body of the post of the poll.

Set the poll to expire after 3 days.
