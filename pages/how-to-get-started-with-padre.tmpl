I recently wrote about <a href="/improving-the-padre-experience.html">Improving the Padre experience</a> and <a href="/perl-projects-for-newbies.html">Perl projects for newbies</a>.
Since then we added a few <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/screenshots.html">screenshots</a>
and recently a few <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/howto.html">howto</a> documents.

So now I need the help of people who are either new to Padre or new to Perl 5 or Perl 6.
What other howtos would you like to see? How can we further ease the way of people to Padre
and to either Perl 5 or 6 using Padre?
