As I mentioned during my lightning talk in Pisa there are a number of tech events in Europe where it would be 
interesting to have Perl presence. The full list of events that I am aware of can be found on the
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?events">events</a> wiki page and the Perl presence
is being organized for some of them already.

If you have time it would be nice to help out the organizers or if you can attend other events, then to
organize something there or if you know about more events, please add them to the wiki.

Here is what is planned so far:

<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?events_2010_froscon">Froscon</a> in St Augustin, Germany
will take place 21-22 August 2010. Organized by Renée Bäcker there is going to be a full track of Perl talks.

<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?events_2010_froscamp_zurich">FrosCamp</a> in Zurich, Switzerland
will be 17-18 September 2010. Organized by Renée Bäcker, as I can see there is going to be a Perl booth and maybe a 
couple of Perl related talks. The dead-line for talk submission is 2010-08-14. Just a few days from now.

<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?events_2010_oswc_malaga">OSWC</a> in Malaga, Spain between
27-28 October 2010. The organizers, Salvador Fandiño, Diego Kuperman, JJ Merelo, Rodrigo de Oliveira are planning to have
a Perl track.

<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?events_2010_blit_potsdam">Brandenburger Linux-Infotag</a> in Potsdam, Germany
on 6 Nov 2010. Organized by Renée Bäcker they are still looking for more people to help out at the Perl booth and give Perl related talks.

<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?events_2010_t_dose_eindhoven">T-Dose</a> in Eindhoven, Holland will be between 6-7 November 2010.
I've just started to organize the Perl presence there. Let me know if you can help out.
