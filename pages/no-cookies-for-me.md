=tags grants, TPF

I've just noticed that the verdict of the TPF grant committee is out
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2009/03/2009q1_grants_results.html">2009 Q1 Grant Results</a>
and both of my proposals were rejected. So no funded work on <a href="http://cpanforum.com/">CPAN::Forum</a>
nor on debugger integration for Padre.

In a way it is sad, not so much 'cause of the money - 
it is not a huge amount after all - but for the <i>lack of official looking support</i>
of TPF. Anyway I am not sure what I am going to do now as I could hardly make 
any progress on the one grant that got accepted in the previous round, integrating
Padre and Parrot. The main problem is that part of the work that has to be done is
XS related and I don't know enough of that to do it. So I am waiting on some
core Parrot developers to implement those features and apparently there are other,
more interesting and urgent things to do. So I wonder if I just should declare
defeat on that grant and let them return the money to the pool?

I am happy I did not take the money they offered up-front.
