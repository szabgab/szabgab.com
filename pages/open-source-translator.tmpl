There are bunch of Open Source projects that try to provide automatic text translation among several languages.

=abstract end


One of the interesting ones is <a href="https://libretranslate.com/">Libre Translate</a> (<a href="https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate">GitHub</a>)
that relies on <a href="https://www.argosopentech.com/">Argos Translate</a> (<a href="https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate">GitHub</a>)

It supports several languages, but if your language is not supported yet you can <a href="https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate/discussions/91">request a language</a>.
I just asked for <b>Ladino</b> support.

As I understand, in order to have another language added one needs to <a href="https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-train">train a model</a>, but I have not figured
out yet what is the input of that training. It seems the <a href="https://opus.nlpl.eu/">Opus project</a> collects texts that have some open license.
Some of these texts are in <a href="https://www.statmt.org/moses/">Moses</a> format - that means two files in which in each row are translations of the
corresponding line in the other file.

You can find data-source in a lot of languages even in Ladino, but the dataset is very small in Ladino.

Anyway, now I have a basic understanding of what kind of corpus I need to find or generate to be used as input.
