Mark Keating has just <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2011/news/779">announced</a>
that <a href="http://www.net-a-porter.com/">Net-A-Porter</a> is sponsoring my
visit to the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2011/">London Perl Workshop</a>
on 12 November 2011.

I am going to provide a 4 hour long training session called <b>Perl Testing</b>.

Here are the details:

<h2>Perl Testing</h2>

If you are changing a piece of code and cannot easily test it,
it is like driving blind-folded on the wrong side of the road.
Not very comforting.

When you are starting a new project it is easy to write lots
of tests as you go along. Either before you write the code or after.
When you are dropped in an existing project, one that might
already be in production, you have a much more difficult task.
In this 4 hour session we will take a look at both cases and
we will have an initial understanding on how to avoid going
crazy while satisfying the requirements of your boss or client.

<ol>
<li>Introduction to TAP - the Test Anything Protocol.</li>
<li>Testing tools in Perl for testing Perl Modules (Test::Simple, Test::More).</li>
<li>Writing unit tests for new code.</li>
<li>What does test coverage mean, how to generate it and how to use it?</li>
<li>Testing web applications.</li>
<li>Testing command line applications.</li>
<li>White box testing, black box testing and what's in between.</li>
</ol>

Most of the time will be spent as a lecture but if you bring
your computer you will be able to do some hands on exercises as well.

The course is based on the
<a href="http://szabgab.com/perl-in-test-automation">QA Test Automation using Perl</a> class.

<h2>What now?</h2>

I still have to buy my flight ticket and reserve a hotel room and think how do I make
this trip really worth the money Net-A-Porter pays and the time I spend.

What do you suggest?
