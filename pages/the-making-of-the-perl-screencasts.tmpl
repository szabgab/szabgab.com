=head1 The making of the Perl screencasts

=tags Perl, screencast

<a href="http://www.dagolden.com/">David Golden</a> asked me how I am preparing 
the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/gabor529">screencasts</a>. I guess I should prepare a 
screencast about that but I think my methods are so lame that I am not sure it is 
worth learning from them. And I don't even use Perl.

The simple version is that I run Ubuntu 10.10 and on top of that I run Windows XP in a VirtualBox.
On the Linux I use a GUI wrapper of <a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/">RecordMyDesktop</a> called, 
<b>Desktop Recorder</b>. I resize the terminal window or the whole <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to 
the size that will look good on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. 
(Yes, that's the part that I am not yet sure which size should that be but see <b>aspect ratio</b> below).
The Desktop Recorder allows me to select a window that I'd like to record. Then I just record my stuff,
sometime 5-10 times till I manage to get it almost acceptable. This generates an ogg file which I can convert to
avi using a GUI wrapper of <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> called <a href="http://winff.org/">WinFF</a>.

I used to upload that file to YouTube.

In the recent screencasts I also added another part in the mix: I launch 
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/">Cheese Webcam Booth</a> and 
using my webcam I record myself while I am doing the screencast. That too generates an ogg file that I turn
into an avi file using WinFF.

Then I launch KDEnlive where I do the editing. Synchronize the two videos. Add some effects
and transitions my son taught me. Add a title clip and an end clip and render it to YouTube.
(See <b>rendering</b> below).
Then upload it.

Now that I gained some experience it takes about 3-4 hours per screencast.

I still have a lot to learn on how to improve the recording and the editing as well as further
getting used to it. While I don't have a lot of problem giving a lightning talk in front of
300 people at a YAPC, I still get really nervous while trying to record myself. Even though
this isn't live. It's a bit better now but I still need to concentrate a lot.

<h2>Aspect Ratio</h2>

(an update to the blog)

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29">Aspect ratio</a> 
refers to the ratio between the width and the height of the picture.
The standard viewer of YouTube uses the 16:9 = 1.77 aspect ratio. 
I installed an application called <b>Screen Ruler</b> and even measured it.

So if I want to have my video fit the screen well (so there won't be wasted black 
stripes on the top, on the bottom or on the sides then I have to take the screencast
of an area that resembles that size. Indeed the screencasts where my screen looks good
were taken on a window that was 830x460 pixels (830:460 = 1.8) 
(e.g. <a href="/padre-on-strawberry-perl-v5-released.html">Padre on Strawberry Perl v5 released</a> and <a href="/using-the-built-in-debugger-of-perl-as-repl.html">Using the built-in debugger of Perl as REPL</a>) while the most recent one (<a href="/fetching-data-from-youtube-using-perl.html">Fetching data from YouTube using Perl</a> was taken on a window size of 
1070x520 pixels (1070 : 520 = 20.5))

The video I take of myself is I think rectangular. I wonder if the aspect ratio is a feature of the
camera or the software I am using. In any case as long as it is not the same aspect ratio as the other
video I think I have two choices. Either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cropping">crop</a> it to 
the same as aspect ratio, removing some parts of the picture or to add the surrounding black bars
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterbox">letter-boxing</a> or 
<a href="pillarbox">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillarbox</a> depending on the orientation.

Still the size of the windows will matter and the actual size of the pixels. I have to learn that.

<h2>Rendering</h2>

(an update to the blog)

I used to render my videos to "Websites / YouTube 640x480" but the quality did not come out well.
I tried "Websites / YouTube 1280 x 720" but that made the sound horrible. I have no idea what is
the issue there though I <a href="http://kdenlive.org/forum/mute-disregarded-some-cases">reported it</a>.
I did not even check if the video quality is better in this version.

I tried to render to "Files / H.264 1000 k" that I think created very good quality even after uploading
to YouTube but the sound was broken there. (Maybe if I record the sound only once then this problem will
be irrelevant).
I also tried "Files / MPEG-4 1000 k". I think the video quality here is already acceptable and the sound
is also OK. So I re-rendered the <a href="/building-a-blog-engine-using-perl-dancer.html">Building a blog engine using Perl Dancer</a> video with this.

<h2>Screencast or workshop?</h2>

Anyway, one day I'll try to show this in a screencast maybe and/or as a 
small workshop at a YAPC. In the meantime, go check out my screencasts and subscribe to my 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/gabor529">channel</a>!
