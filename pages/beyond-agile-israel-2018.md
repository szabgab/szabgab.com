The <a href="https://www.beyondagileisrael.com/">Beyond Agile Israel</a> conference will take place on 8th February 2018,
with several additional events in the 2 weeks preceeding the coference.

As good as conferences can be to talk to meet other people, they usually don't provide the relaxed environment nature
can provide to build relationships and start cooperations.

Hence I organizing a one-day trip to the Dead Sea that includes a hike and maybe even some floating in the Dead Sea,
though the water tempreature might not allow that.



(If you are wondering, check out similar tours that I've organized at other <a href="/events.html">tech-events</a>.)

<h2>Hike in Nahal David - Ein Gedi and floating in the Dead Sea</h2>

This is a one-day trip.

The <a href="https://israelhiking.osm.org.il/#!/?s=udaQ5IWzbp">planned route</a>
is about 6.6 km long and has 400 m elevation. I expect it tot take about 4-5 hours.

It is about 2 hours drive from Tel Aviv.

Then we head over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Bokek">Ein Bokek</a> the "hotel area" in the southern part of the Dead-Sea.
This is an excellent place to swim, or rather float in the Dead-Sea. They also have nice showers so we could wash off the salt.
However I am not sure the water will be warm enough to get in.

There is an alternative however, to get in the <a href="http://www.eingediseaofspa.com/">Ein Gedi Spa</a>.

<h2>What to bring</h2>

<ul>
<li>Good hiking shoes.</li>
<li>3 liters of water.</li>
<li>Hat</li>
<li>Sun protection cream.</li>
<li>Bathing suit, towel if you'd like to get in the water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When</h2>

Friday 9th February 2018.

<h2>Costs</h2>

The entrance ticket to the Nachal David Nature reserve is 28 NIS / person.

As I can see the <a href="http://www.eingediseaofspa.com/prices">price of the Spa</a> is 95 NIS / person.

<h2>Transportation</h2>

I can take 4 people in my car and if there are more people interested, we might be able to find another car.
In any case we'll have to discuss the details.


If you are interested to join, let me know via e-mail to Gabor Szabo szabgab@gmail.com and
we discuss the details.
