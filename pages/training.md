=testimony Ofer Chen = DevOps Engineer. = /img/ofer-chen.jpeg = https://www.linkedin.com/in/0ferchen/ = Gabor provided a training course to my operations team at Intel. Gabor was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about both the language he taught and the environment we needed to use it. The course helped us a lot understanding and enhancing the existing scripts, and even to create new automated tools.
