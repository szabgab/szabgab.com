<a href="http://www.mystartuplife.com/">My Start-Up Life</a> was written by <a href="http://ben.casnocha.com/">Ben Casnocha</a> and I enjoyed reading it very much.

First I thought to put here a few quotes from the book but I guess every reader takes different ideas from this book. 
So I think I'd better leave it to you to read the book and decide which sentence is important to you.

The book is packed with quotes from some very bright people and it is very readable. 
It is broken down to chapters numbered 1.0-18.0 but within chapters there are lots of sections
making it easier to read and stop and read some more.

I am happy I spent my time reading it.

This is of course not a Perl specific topic but I think it might be a good read for every Perl
developer who still wants to change the world.
