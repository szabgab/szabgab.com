I am starting a new weekly newsletter called Developer Weekly.

There are over 100 "Engineering blogs" or "Developers blogs" published by major tech companies such as LinkedIN,
Etsy, Netflix, Google. Just to name a few. Recently I have started to read them and there were quite a few interesting
articles.



In this weekly newsletter I am going to include a few selected items with some commentary of my own.

The first episode is due on September 1st, 2017.

Go ahead and subscribe: Developer Weekly.  developer-weekly.com


<h2>Update on 20 January 2018</h2>

It did not work out so I shut it down.
