## About me

These days I primarily focus on providing training. The main subjects are

* Rust programming
* Python programming
* Git, GitHub/GitLab
* Test Automation and Continuous Integration (CI)
* Docker

## More about me

I help people, teams, and organizations improve their engineering practices, increase the speed of development, reduce the risk of bugs.
Introducing and improving (Test) Automation, Continuous Integration, Extreme Programming, and DevOps practices.

The service is always tailored to the specific needs, but it usually includes some of the following:

* Help moving to a more flexible <b>Version Control</b> system, or improved use of the current system. (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
* Introduction to <b>test automation</b> including unit, integration, acceptance, and regression test. Mocking, if needed.
* Improve development, QA, and operations processes and how they interact.
* Setting up <b>Continuous Integration (CI)</b> (Jenkins or GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines, etc.)
* Setting up <b>Continuous Deployment (CD)</b>
* Help with <b>refactoring</b> code.
* Introduce the use of <b>(Docker) containers</b>.
* Introduce the use of <b>cloud</b>-based systems. (AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, Linode)
* Training and coaching people.

Sometimes my work includes building internal web sites.

I also love explaining things and provide class-room [training](/training) to my clients.

The languages I usually deal with are Rust, Python, Perl, Bash, Groovy, and JavaScript, though many of the services I provide are language independent.

[Contact me](/contact) if you are interested.

I am the author of several books published on Leanpub:
For example [Collaborative Development using Git and GitHub](https://leanpub.com/collab-dev-git/) and [Single Page Application with Perl Dancer](https://leanpub.com/dancer-spa/).

<h2>A few words about myself</h2>

I was born in 1967 in Budapest, Hungary. After successfully graduating from
<a href="http://www.fazekas.hu/">Fazekas</a>, one of the most competitive high-schools in the
country, I thought I can learn everything. Even Theoretical Mathematics.

During high-school I got my first programmable calculator
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-702P">Casio FX-702P</a>.
<img src="/img/Casio_FX-702P_Programmable_Calculator.png">

I also had access to <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/HT%E2%80%931080Z">HT-1080Z</a> computers in the
school computer-lab. It is a clone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80</a>.

Later I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>
<img src="img/ZXSpectrum48k.png">

It took two years to understand that Theoretical Mathematics is way too much for me,
so in 1989 I decided to make some adjustments. It involved moving to Israel, spending almost a year in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%27an">Kibbutz Na'an</a>, learning Hebrew
and then starting to learn Computer Sciences and Business Administration at the
<a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/">Hebrew University</a>. I graduated in 1993 and then
went on to do an MBA in the same place while working full time in various hi-tech companies.

The first company I worked for was Digital (DEC). I worked there only a few months writing
automated test for the Ethernet and Fast Ethernet chips they have been developing.

When that project finished I got accepted to a company called Rosh Maarachot Chosvot, which was
later renamed ServiceSoft. I worked there as a programmer writing in Awk and Scheme and slowly
learning system administration on the Novell network.

About a year after I started to work there the company moved to the US and the
offices, including all the employees were purchased by NetManage that was expanding at that time.
I started to work on the newly setup Windows NT servers and was working on the
version control system that was PVCS, the bug tracking system (DDTS).
I ran the build machines for the developers. That's where I learned Perl.

A little jump here ... one day I'll have to fill in the white pages.
Other companies I worked for: Agentsoft, Phasecom (later Vyyo), Goldnames.

Since about 2000 I have been providing training classes and development services
in Perl and some other open source technologies. (e.g. Subversion, Git, Linux command line).
I also teach Python.

I am providing these classes both in Israel and overseas.

<h2>Open Source Development</h2>

I have been writing Perl since 1995 and teaching it since 2000.
I've started the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a> (2008.06-2014.10),
I am the maintainer of a number of <a href="/training">modules on CPAN</a>,
and I have <a href="https://metacpan.org/about/contributors">contributed</a> to the <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a>.
My <a href="https://github.com/szabgab">GitHub</a> account contains quite a few other projects as well.

My <a href="https://gitlab.com/szabgab">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/szabgab/">Bitbucket</a> accounts are a lot less active.


Throughout the years I have contributed to several Perl modules on
<a href="https://metacpan.org/author/SZABGAB">CPAN</a> including
<a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> itself.
Developed and maintained the <a href="http://cpanforum.com/">CPAN::Forum</a> a community web forum,
and the <a href="http://pcas.szabgab.com/">Perl Community AdServer</a>. I had to shut down both
due to lack of interest.
<br>
In addition I created <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>.

## Social activity

I restarted the <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">Israel Perl Mongers</a> and created
a lively environment for local Perl enthusiastic in Israel. With the invaluable help of
other Mongers I have organized several Perl and <a href="http://osdc.org.il/">Open Source</a>
conferences in Israel. The community now has monthly
meetings both in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem and a busy mailing list.

While the Hungarian Perl Mongers had a mailing list for some time already I have registered
the <b>perl.org.hu</b> domain so we'll have a constant place to
go when looking for Perl related information. Donated the hardware to run the web site and the
mailing list and even organized with the great help of some other people two Perl Workshops in
Budapest.

I organized hikes (in the near-by mountains) for the speakers of <a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft Conf</a>
to facilitate opportunities for off-conference bonding and conversations.
( <a href="/craft-conf-2017">2017</a>, <a href="/craft-conf-2018">2018</a>, <a href="/hiking-after-craft-2019">2019</a>).
I organized the <a href="/bof-at-craft-conf-2019">BOFs at Craft Conf 2019</a>.

For my contribution to Open Source in Israel, in 2009, I received the
<a href="http://wiki.hamakor.org.il/index.php/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A1_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8#.D7.AA.D7.A8.D7.95.D7.9E.D7.94_.D7.9C.D7.A7.D7.95.D7.93_.D7.A4.D7.AA.D7.95.D7.97">Hamakor Prize</a>
from <a href="https://www.hamakor.org.il/">HaMakor</a>, the Israeli non-profit for Open Source and Free Software. (The pages are in Hebrew).

Mostly for my community work, in 2008, I received the
<a href="http://whitecamel.org/">White Camel Award</a>.

## Other Projects

* <a href="https://tech-talks.code-maven.com/">Tech Talks for Technical Leaders</a>

## Blog

Even before it was called a blog I used to write in the <b>use Perl journal</b>
and later in <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
Nowadays I mostly write on the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/), [Python Maven](https://python.code-maven.com/), and the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> sites
and on the <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a>.

<h2>Newsletter</h2>

On a regular basis I am sending out two newsletters.
One called <a href="/test-automation-tips">Test Automation Tips</a>
and the other called and <a href="perl6">Perl 6 Tricks and Treats</a>.
