Once in a while I share some stats of some of the Perl-related web sites. For example at the beginning of 2014 I
wrote about the <a href="/the-popularity-of-perl-in-2013.html">popularity of Perl</a> bases on some numbers from 2013.

This time I just share the numbers as appear in Google Analytics for a number of sites where I have access to this data.

The same numbers in text:

This is the data for the dates Sep 16 - Oct 16 2014.

It is quite interesting to compare the 5 numbers for each site.
One should remember though that based on my observation the "Sessions" can fluctuate as much as 3-5% each day and
these were 'high' numbers.  The 'Session Duration' and 'Bounce Rate' are quite stable.
