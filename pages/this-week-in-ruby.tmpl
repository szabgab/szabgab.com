I am subscribed to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/israelrb">Israel.rb</a>
- the local Ruby mailing list.
It had a nice start about a year ago. The guys even had a few face to face
meeting but it seems due to lack of interest that faded away culminating in the
recent post titled
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/israelrb/browse_thread/thread/d3d92798f31276"> This group is dead, now what we
gonna do?</a>

The other, more interesting message a few days ago was from Adam Fine, the guy who
started the group wrote
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/israelrb/browse_thread/thread/cfc8e3fbb63bd3ad">an overview
about the various implementations of Ruby</a> and their state. It was quite a good
reading and it even made it to the
<a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/05/12/this-week-in-ruby-may-12-2008/">weekly report</a>
of  <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/">Antonio Cangiano</a>.

That brings me to what the Perl community might learn from the recent success of Ruby:

<ul>
<li>Ruby has <a href="">RubyForge</a></li>
<li>There is a Windows installer called
<a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/rubystack">RubyStack</a> that includes
the whole stack of applications needed for Ruby on Rails development,
including, well everything.</li>
<li>Ruby has the above mentioned This week in Ruby message which make it easy for
people who are not deeply involved in the community to follow what's going on.</li>
<li>The also struggle with occasional (?)
<a href="http://novemberain.com/2008/5/11/state-of-merb-before-1-0-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">bad
publicity</a>. This one was about the state of <a href="http://merbivore.org/">Merb</a> - yet another MVC
framework.
</li>
</ul>

I can't say if any of this has contributed to the success - especially not the last one - but I think they help.
