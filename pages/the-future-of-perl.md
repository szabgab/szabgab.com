I just watched the excellent keynote of <a href="http://jesstess.com/">Jessica McKellar</a> 
at Kiwi PyCon 2013 titled
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1a4Jbjc-vU">The Future of Python - A Choose Your Own Adventure</a>
It is 35 min long.

=abstract end

The key points were:

<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Games</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Science</li>
</ul>

she also mentions that the <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Foundation</a> can help with money and people.

<h2>The budget of the Perl Foundation vs the Python foundation</h2>

So I checked a bit. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation">Wikipedia</a>
the PSF had a budget of $750,000 in 2011.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perl_Foundation">Wikpedia does not know</a> the budget of
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>, but in the
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2014/02/2013-year-end-report.html">2013 year end report</a>
we can see the following expenses:

  Grants:                  105,000
  Conferences:             106,795
  Community and Marketing:   8,805
  Administration:           10,896
                          --------
  TOTAL:             USD   231,496


<h2>Perl or Python?</h2>

So why is this intersting?
Because the some of the same opportunities exist for the Perl community as well.

You just have to <b>choose your own adventure</b>.
