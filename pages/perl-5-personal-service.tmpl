I thought about this on and off for some time but have not
done anything with it yet. Maybe someone else with better ideas
can do something like this.

I was wondering if it would be interesting to create a web application
that on one hand would allow people using Perl to get some personalized
services on the other hand it would allow the ongoing collection of some
statistical data about the Perl community and about the usage of Perl.


The services that would be offered could include alert when one of the modules
used by the person gets a new version. It could include a Google-alert like 
service when the modules are mentioned in one of the perl related sources.

It could allow the notification about Perl related events in their city/country/continent.

It could allow people to mark their favorite modules.
It could allow to <i>follow</i> other people whose judgement
they trust for modules which in turn would provide a better way to search for modules
on CPAN for everyone.

It would allow an on-going survey similar to the one that was a year or two ago but 
that would allow people to change the data they provide and allow the site maintainers
to provide information regarding the changes as well.
