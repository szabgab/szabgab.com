=head1 How to prepare a surprise birthday party

=tags Perl, Padre, party

I woke up way too early today and sat down in the living room opening my netbook 
and opening <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>. I was surprised to 
see a pop-up telling me it is the birthday of Padre and inviting me to
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/irc.html?channel=padre">join the developers on the IRC channel</a>.

That was great.

I did not remember when Adam Kennedy added it. Apparently he has 
<a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/padre/2011-07-20#i_4140097">forgotten</a> as well.

Apparently it started when a (or the?) 
<a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/padre/2011-07-19#i_4138344">spacechicken</a> joined the IRC channel
but it has been <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/padre/2011-07-20">going on</a> since then.
Lots of people came by. Said hi. Said Happy Birthday. Thanked the developers for building Padre.
Told us how much they like the project.

It's awesome good feeling.

<b>Thank you all</b> and special thanks to 
<a href="http://ali.as/">Adam Kennedy</a> for setting up the surprise party!
