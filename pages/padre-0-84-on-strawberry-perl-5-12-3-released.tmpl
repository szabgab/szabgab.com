=tags Padre, Perl, IDE, Windows, release

Curtis Jewell has recently released <a href="http://csjewell.dreamwidth.org/20183.html">Strawberry Perl 5.12.3.0</a>
so I went ahead and built a package that also includes Padre 0.84, the latest source release on CPAN.

It is a zip file and there is no installer for it. You can download it from 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/DownloadWindows">here</a>.

Once downloaded, follow the instruction on that page.

Comments are welcome here or on the regular channels of <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>.
