Today I participated in an online panel called **Jewish Language Project: Ladino Today** a panel discussion
of some of the central figures in the Academic world of Ladino. It was very fascinating and touched a lot of
topics.

I am not in the academy. My interest for learning Ladino is to learn more about the culture
and to be able to speak with people. I probably don't see many aspects of the questions, so let me just
write down what I think could help others like me.

Many of the Ladino-related web sites look like they were build 20-25 years ago. Many seem to be unmaintained.
I think it would be important to improve the look and the functionality of the web sites.

It would be important to have online dictionaries. I think having an open source Ladino dictionary hosted on [wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) would be a good idea.

Getting Ladino to [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) could be useful.

People mentioned online applications and games.

I'd say a Ladino course on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) would be fantastic, but [LibreLingo](https://librelingo.app/)
might provide a much more suitable place for it as that can be a lot more flexible than Duolingo. I've already started creating
3 Ladino courses using English, Spanish, and Hebrew as the source languages.

To me having access to people who speak the language and who are interested in transferring it seem like a critical part.
This could be done by encouraging people to offer Ladino classes via [italki](https://www.italki.com/i/EFbbfc?hl=en_us),
but there could be also a more manual system of connecting Ladino students with Ladino speakers.
I know Bryan Kirschen on  [Ladino Linguist](https://ladinolinguist.com/) has such a project for his students.

The [Ladino version of Wikipedia](https://lad.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Primera_Hoja) has 3,607 pages and many of them only have
a single line and as I can see there are many modern Spanish words used in the text.
It might be more important to make other texts easily accessible online.

I started a page collecting [resources about Ladino](https://ladino.szabgab.com/).
