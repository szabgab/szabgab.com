According to Priit Potter 
<a href="http://plumbr.eu/blog/how-many-java-developers-in-the-world">there are 8,311,000 Java developers</a>
in the world.

The number is based on several factors. One of them is the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE Index</a>.

That index claims that Java has 15% while Perl has about 1%. Based on these numbers we might thing that there re 8,311,00/15 = <b>554,066</b>
Perl developers. More or less.

In the article about the <a href="/the-popularity-of-perl-in-2013.html">popularity of Perl</a> I mentioned that in December 2013 there were 84,810
visits to the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a>. I should add that those visits were by 59,728 Unique visitors.
Slightly more than 10% of the estimated total number of Perl developers.

In the same period of time, <a href="http://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> had 82,339 Unique visitors and <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a>
had 31,859 Unique Visitors.
