I have just received an e-mail from the organizers of <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> that
my request for a Perl stand was accepted. This means we are going to have a table on the two days of FOSDEM
(Saturday and Sunday, 6-7 February 2010) where we can present Perl and related projects.

We need to ensure there are always people at the stand, that we have material to hand out. We have to make sure
projects that can be interesting to people who are <b>not (yet) Perl developers</b> are well represented. I hope 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> will finance some interesting give-aways.

There were a couple if ideas we discussed with <a href="http://martian.org/karen/">Karen Pauley</a> and 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~sjn/journal/">Salve J. Nilsen</a>. For example the 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hfb/56871343/in/photostream/">wooden round tuits</a>
we got on previous YAPCs and the <a href="http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/37309">baseball cards</a> 
the Nordic Perl Workshop organizers handed out.

We also talked about the possibility to prepare a CD or DVD with various Perl projects on it. It could hold
a version of <a href="http://www.strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl for Windows</a> or a Virtual Box 
image holding installed versions of several projects or the same but in a bootable image format. Something like
<a href="/perl-virtual-appliances">Perl Virtual Appliances</a>.

Very soon we are going to have a mailing list to coordinate the Perl presence on this and other events. 
I'll announce the creation of the list. In the meantime if you are planning to come to FOSDEM and would
like to represent a project or if you just would like to participate in the organization please let me know 
by sending and e-mail to <a href="/contact">me</a>.
