Sometime I still need to work on the projects of my clients.

<h2>Yesterday</h2>

I ended up working on the projects of one of my clients most of the day.

In the evening I though I'll work a bit on the <a href="https://osdc.code-maven.com/open-source-by-organizations/">OS organizations</a> project
and announced it on the Maakaf Discord. I ended up talking to people and introducing my projects for almost 2 hours.


<h2>Today</h2>

In the morning I managed to work on the <a href="https://osdc.code-maven.com/open-source-by-organizations/">OS organizations</a> project.
Made sure all the filenames are the same as the domain name and even managed to add a few entries and improved the README.

Then I worked on the content of OSDC course in general and the one I am going to do at PyCon Israel.
I set up its website and managed to fix the issue with the HTML and CSS with the instances.

Then I had a meeting with the organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/github-user-group/">GitHub User Group</a>.
