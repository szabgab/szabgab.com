For my work on the [dist://Perl6::Cookbook] I wanted to check out 
how one can go and start using Perl 6 ? I have to admit that it was not clear
to me so let me write down one of the approaches currently available.

You need an <b>editor</b> and one of the <b>Perl 6 implementations</b>.

<h2>Editor</h2>

The editor can be vim, emacs or any other text editor good for programming.
I think both vim and emacs already have Perl 6 mode, I don't know about the others
but I am not planning to write about any of these. I obviously will 
recommend <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> and its
[dist://Padre::Plugin::Perl6]

<h2>Perl 6 implementation</h2>

Perl 6 is planned to have multiple implementation like most of the other languages
have but unlike Perl 5 which only has a single implementation. I am going to use
<a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl</a> running on 
<a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> as it is the one that 
currently shows the biggest potential.

<h2>Padre</h2>

Installing Padre can be easy or difficult depending on various things,
most notably luck. Generally it should be enough to type <i>install Padre</i>
in your CPAN shell but there might be some extra steps you need to make
in order to get that work.
The <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/wiki/Download">download page of Padre</a>
provides further details. <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva 2009</a>
and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora 10</a> already have Padre packaged 
and while those are old version, it might be the best to use their package 
management and then upgrade. They might even provide backported versions of 
the latest Padre.


<h2>Padre, Parrot and Rakudo on Windows</h2>

If you are running Windows we distribute a version of
Portable Strawberry Perl (beta 1) with all the necessary pieces already 
installed. It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/wiki/PortableStrawberry">the Padre web site</a>

It is currently 60 Mb zipped and 300 MB unzipped, which is a lot, but it is 
worth a try. 

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the file you should move it to c:\portable 
or some similar path (currently no spaces are allowed in the path). Assuming
you put it in C:\portable  you can then go to <b>c:\portable\perl\bin\</b> and run the
<b>portablepadre.bat</b> file. That should start Padre with an empty file.
Type in 

  use v6;

  say "Hello World";
  42.say;

and press F5. When offered to save the file chose a name with .p6 extension.
It should run your code and provide the output in the lower output pane of
Padre.

The Syntax highlighting is relatively slow, so it is tuned off by default
but you can run in manually with the F6 key or in the Plugins/Perl6 menu.

Enjoy!

<h2>Update</h2>

Apparently the parrot and rakudo I distributed does not work as it has some hard
code path requirements.

Tomorrow I'll try to build a new version which will include the missing files and
will require you to install it in a specific location but will hopefully work then.
