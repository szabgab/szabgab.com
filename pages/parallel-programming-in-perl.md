=abstract start

In the last few days I have been working on a new Perl course. It is called <a href="https://code-maven.teachable.com/p/parallel-processing-in-perl">Parallel processing in Perl</a>
and it is being sold on Teachable now.

=abstract end

I prepared several examples showing speed improvement when using <b>fork</b> in Perl. Rented a server at <a href="https://code-maven.com/digitalocean">Digital Ocean</a>
so I can show what happens if you have 32 cores. It was interesting. I was a bit nerveous while recording it as that server is rather expensive. About $640 / month.

But it is funny. I should do it more often to get used to it. After all that is still only $1/hour and they actually charge by the minute or by the second.
So if I turn it on to record some videos that take 20 minutes it is still less than a $1. A laughable amount if we compare it with the potential gain. Both for the course
and for myself.

Even though I knew the material quite well it took me a few days to prepare the examples and the slides and even during the recordings I had to update many of them to include
more interesting example.

I recorded almost 90 minutes already and for some of the videos  I had to do several "takes". It takes some repetition till I figure out more or less what I want to say.

I still have not got to the "real" part of the course though. So far I "only" explained and showed how fork works, but did not show any of the examples that I wanted to improve
the speed. I guess it will take a few more days.

Nevertheless I published the course and created discount coupons for the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> readers for the followers of my
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/perl-maven/">Perl Maven LinkedIn page</a> and for the followers of my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PerlMaven">Perl Maven Facebook page</a>.
