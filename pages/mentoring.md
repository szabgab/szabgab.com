## Why

In many cases formal <a href="/training">training</a> cannot be arranged or does not match the requirements. For example you have a specific application you need to understand and improve.
Maybe in your team you are the only Perl developer and you don't have anyone to consult with.

You might know you need to improve your skills but there is no time to attend a full, formal training course. You'd rather spend an hour a day for a longer period of time than to have a 5 day 8 hours a day intensive course.

You'd rather learn in connection to the specific issues you face than the generic material that is used in the training
classes.

You'd like to make sure that the time and money you spend already improves the code-base you are working on.

## Mentoring

In such and similar case it might be better for you to convince your manager to get mentoring.

For communication we can use various techniques, including Skype, IRC, Google Talk, e-mails or even regular phone. Whatever might fits your schedule.

Normally mentor-ship is bought in blocks of 10 hours and we set a fixed but flexible schedule on how you spend the allocated time.
