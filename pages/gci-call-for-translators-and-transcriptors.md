The GCI - Google Code-In - has started 2 days ago.
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> participates
through the heroic work
Florian Ragwitz (rafl), Paul Johnson ( pjcj ) and Mark Keating ( mdk )

The dead-line for the first round was extended to 27 November 2011.
In the 2 days since it started, I think I saw what is missing.
I'd like to ask for your help.



<h2>Translations</h2>

Some of the tasks are translations of the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Mojolicious::Guides::FAQ">Mojolicious::Guides::FAQ</a></li>
<li><a href="http://moose.perl.org/">The Moose website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://openwebmail.org/">Open WebMail</a></li>
<li>The GUI of Padre, <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">the Perl IDE</a></li>
<li>Several <a href="http://www.youtube.com/gabor529">Perl-related screencasts</a> I made and put on YouTube</li>
</ul>

Having translations in your language can be of a great help
getting people started. They will have to learn English
eventually, but it's a nice help. Especially for younger people.

<h2>Mentors in non-English languages</h2>

In order to have translations in your language, we first need
mentors who speak your language fluently and who
would be ready to help a bit.

Once we have that, we will also need students, but as
I could see in these two days that's less of a problem.

<h2>We need mentors</h2>

If you think this is a good cause and you have some time,
please sign up.

Here is the process:

<ol>
<li>Sign up as a mentor on <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/profile/mentor/google/gci2011">Melange</a></li>.
<li>Join the #gci channel on irc.perl.org.<br />
If you don't have an IRC client you can follow
<a href="http://wbe004.mibbit.com/?autoConnect=true&server=irc.perl.org&channel=%23gci&nick=">this link</a></li>
<li>Talk to Paul Johnson ( pjcj ) or Florian Ragwitz ( rafl ) who can invite  you to the TPF program.</li>
<li>Let them know you are ready to mentor translations.
They will probably schedule a few translation tasks to your language
and when they need your help, they will let you know.</li>
</ol>

Once there are a few tasks we can send out another call for students.


<h2>English transcriptions</h2>

In order to translate the screencasts, first we need
the English transcription of the text. That's useful
even without translations for people who are not
comfortable with my accent.

Currently there are only 3 screencasts with transcription
so the translators cannot proceed.

That's where we need your help. We need both
students and mentors to do and check the transcriptions.

<h2>We need students</h2>

If you have a child at home who is 13-17 years old,
or if you are between those years,
don't hesitate to send him/her to volunteer!

Students need to <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/profile/student/google/gci2011">sign up</a>
and then join the IRC channel as explained above and ask around.

I think that's it.

If you'd like to get in the first round you have only 4 days left for that.
