=head1 BOFs at Craft-Conf 2019
=timestamp 1556517018
=tags BOF



This is just a placeholder to help me plan the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">BOFs</a> for <a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft-Conf 2019</a>.



Once the schedule of the BOFs is ready, it will be published on the official Craft Conf website.

The idea is to provide a place and time where participants with similar interests can easily find each other and talk to each other.
It would also be great if this was an opportunity for the participants to be able to find the speakers and talk to them.

Speakers who agree to participate in such BOF, would pick a subject that interests them and a preferred time-slot. Speakers who
come later can either join an already scheduled BOF or have another one at another timeslot. Once the schedule of the
talks is ready we'll try to fit in the BOF to match the preferences of the speakers.

When we get closer to the conference we'll pick a location somewhere in the conference venue for each BOF.

We'll promote it via the <a href="https://craft-conf.com/">conference web site</a> and during the conference.

At the given time each speak show up at his/her designated place and if people come by they greet them and help them engage with each other
or with the speaker.

We have put together a list of topics just as ideas. You can of course come up with any other subject you think could be interesting.

If you agree I'll put your name and topic on this page and we'll build up the schedule together.

<h2>Topic ideas</h2>

Feel free to pick one of these or to come up with somethine else. Something more specific. Something wider.
Whatever you feel right.
