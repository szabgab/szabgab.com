=head1 Poll: What are you using besides Perl?

=tags Perl, poll, editor, IDE

Last month I ran a 5-sec poll asking you about 
<a href="http://perlide.org/poll200910/">your preferred editor or IDE for writing Perl</a>. 
Now I am running another quick, 5-sec poll trying to find out <a href="http://perlide.org/poll200911/">what else, 
besides Perl, are you editing with your editor?</a>. I'd appreciate if you took the 5 seconds
to answer this question.
