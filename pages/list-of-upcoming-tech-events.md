=head1 List of upcoming tech events

=tags Perl, events, promotion, Spain, Malaga

In "<a href="/grant-request-for-fund-raising-and-promotional-activities.html">Grant request for fund-raising and promotional activities</a>" I mentioned I'll go over the list of tech 
<a href="http://www.socialtext.net/perl5/index.cgi?events">events</a> and try to refresh them. Unfortunately only 2 or 3
people made any changes to the wiki since then but today in the morning I went over the list. It took me about 4 hours 
and as I can see I'll need to do this at least once a month as there are many events that are not yet scheduled for next year.

In addition I signed up to the mailing lists of several <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Monger</a> groups and 
sent them messages listing all the events that are near to where they group is located. To some value if "near".

From one of the replies I learned that there is going to be a Perl track at
<a href="http://www.opensourceworldconference.com/malaga10/">Software Libre Open Source World Conference in Malaga</a>
That looks nice.
