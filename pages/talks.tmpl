<p class="talk-title">The Quality of CPAN Modules</p>
<p>(60 minutes)</p>
<p>
How can I know that a module I download from the "Internet" is of hight quality ?
This question comes up very often among new Perl programmers who come from a world
of proprietary software. In this presentation I go over a number of tools Perl module developers
use to make sure their modules is of hight quality and let you, the user of find out which module
will meet your requirements. During the talk I am visiting the following web sites:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://testers.cpan.org/">CPAN Testers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">RT</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/cpants_paper.html">CPANTS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cpanplus.sourceforge.net/">CPANPLUS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPANRATINGS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://qa.perl.org/">QA-Perl</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I gave this talk on <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/20040909.html">9th September 2004 for the Israeli Perl Mongers</a>
and will likely to give it <a href="http://jerusalem.perl.org.il">in Jerusalem</a> again.
</p>
<p>
As I had to prepare this talk quite in the last minute and did not have time to prepare <i>proper</i>
slide I used a Wiki to put together a couple of items.
The result is a bunch of notes about
<a href="/talks/quality_of_cpan_modules.html">The Quality of CPAN Modules</a>.
</p>

<a name="installing"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Installing Perl and Perl Modules, while doing good to the community</p>
<p>(30-60 minutes)</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile and install the latest version of Perl in your home directory</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS">CPANPLUS.pm</a></li>
<li>Install modules using CPANPLUS and reporting test results</li>
<li>What to do when a module fails to be installed using the usual methods of CPAN.pm</li>
</ul>

<a name="presentations"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Presentation Tools</p>
<p>(20 minutes)</p>
<p>
A short talk about the tool I used to generate my presentations as presented at the 7th November,
2002 meeting of the <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/20021107.html">Israeli Perl Mongers</a>
You can also read the slides of the <a href="/talks/Presentation/">Presentation Tools</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since I gave this talk I gradually replaced my self-written presentation generator
to one using <a href="http://www.docbook.org/">Docbook</a> but as it turns out this one
still works	and has a much nicer style sheet for HTML than the one I am using now.
</p>


<a name="web-development"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Web development on Linux</p>
<p>(30-60 min)</p>
<p>
I start from the explanation of the ASP web development	model supported by Microsoft.
In the first part of the presentation this framework is compared to various other technologies
such as the Java/JSP/J2EE, PHP and CGI.
</p>
<p>
In the second half of the presentation I go into details of the Perl world of web development
and talk about such technologies as mod_perl, Apache::ASP, Mason, Embedded Perl and various
Templating systems.
</p>
<p>
This was presented on the Go-Linux conference on 10th April, 2003.
You can read the slides of <a href="/talks/Webintro">Introduction to Web Development on Linux</a> as
I used them on the Go-Linux conference.
</p>


<a name="debug"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Debugging Perl - using the available debuggers</p>
<p>(40 min)</p>
<p>
There are lots of people who are adding print lines to
their code in order to debug it. There is nothing bad about
those print statements but there are other ways to debug your
code that sometimes make more sense.
</p>
<p>
I am going to pick up some sample program with a few bugs and use
various tools to debug the code. First I'll give a few ideas how
to improve your print statements if you prefer to stay with them.
Then I'll give a short introduction to the built-in debugger of perl
and we see how we can use it to debug our code.
</p>
<p>
Finally I'll give an introduction to Tk based graphical debugger,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-ptkdb">Devel::ptkdb</a> of Andrew E.Page.
In this part I'll show how to use the
GUI tool for basic debugging and then I go on and show a couple of
additional features not in the basic set of operations, that might be
helpful. I'll show how you can use the powerful macro language that
comes with this tool.
</p>

<p>
See the slides of <a href="/talks/Debug/">Debugging Perl</a> as presented on
<a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/">YAPC::Europe::2003</a> in Paris, France.
</p>

<a name="debug2"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Write your own debugger for Perl</p>
<p>(20 min)</p>
<p>
When debugging your code you can either insert print
statements and run your code or you can use various
interactive debuggers and step through your code.
</p>
<p>
This is very nice but sometimes you will want to collect
debugging and other information about your code without
inserting print statements and without stepping through
10,000 lines of code.
</p>
<p>
In this presentation am showing a couple of examples of how you can
use the hooks in the Perl debugger to collect that information.

</p>
<a name="parrot"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Parrot, the future of dynamic languages</p>
<p>(20-60min)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> is the Virtual Machine that will be used
to execute Perl 6, Perl 5 via <a href="http://www.poniecode.org/">Ponie</a> and hopefully a bunch
of other languages too.
</p>
<p>I gave this presentation in front of some 500 IT managers and CTOs on the Go-Linux conference
in Tel Aviv, Israel on 22nd December 2004. People got very enthusiastic about it. In this conference
I had to finish the talk in 20 minutes but actually I have more to say using the same slides.
</p>
<p>You can download the slides in both <a href="/talks/parrot.pdf">PDF</a> and
<a href="/talks/parrot.sxi">Open Office Presentation</a> format or <a href="/talks/parrot/">view them on-line</a>.
</p>

<a name="code-reading"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Code Reading</p>
<p>(20-60min)</p>
<p>
Reading the code others write can be very educational. You can see new
constructs of grammar and brilliant solution or you can learn from the
mistakes others	do.
</p>
<p>
In this session we will use two web applications to learn from their code.
First we will look at the code behind perl.org.il which is a static
site built using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Template">HTML::Template</a>.
Then we will look at <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Forum">CPAN::Forum</a> which is
planned to be web forum software aimed at CPAN modules.
</p>
<p>
This is also a good opportunity to get familiar with some web
development technologies such as <a href="http://seach.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Application">CGI::Application</a>.
</p>

<a name="qa-in-opensource"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Test Automation in Open Source Projects</p>
<p>(60min)</p>
<p>
It is hard to know how to automatically test a large application.
Luckily in the open source world there are several very good examples on how
this is accomplished and we can learn from these examples.
</p>
<p>
During the talk we'll go over the testing frameworks
(build servers, smoke servers, reporting systems) employed by several
open source projects.
</p>
<p>
We'll take a look at Perl 5, CPAN, Perl 6, Parrot, SQLite, PostgreSQL,
GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and many other projects.
See blog entries I write about
<a href="/quality-assurance-and-automated-testing-in-open-source-software.html">Quality Assurance and Automated Testing in Open Source Software</a>.
and the <a href="/test-automation-tips">Test Automation Tips</a> newsletter.

<a name="tap"></a>
<p class="talk-title">The evolution of testing, introduction to TAP</p>
<p>(approx 60min)</p>
<p>
This is an introduction on how manual testing evolves via writing
small test scripts into data driven test system. During the talk we
introduce the <a href="http://testanything.org/">TAP, the Test Anything Protocol</a>
</p>

<a name="padre"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Padre, the Perl IDE</p>
<p>(60 minutes)</p>
<p>
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre is a Perl IDE</a>
written in Perl using wxWidgets.
It tries to provide both a way to help beginners or people who
are not hard-core Perl developers to get through the day without
too many scars and it also provides a framework in which large
applications can be developed easily.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, first you'll see an introduction on how to use
Padre for Perl 5 and Perl 6 development. You'll see a couple
of examples that help the beginners and some other examples
of features that might be interesting for you during large
application development.
</p>
<p>
In addition we'll go in details on how to write a plug-in for Padre.
</p>



<a name="padre-fosdem-2010"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Padre, the Perl IDE: Building an open source team, getting the project to users against the odds</p>
<p>(20-30 minutes)</p>
<p>
This talk was given on <a href="http://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM, 2010 in Brussels, Belgium</a>. It was <a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/events/padre_the_perl_ide">scheduled</a> as a 15 min
lightning talk.
</p>

<p>
When I started to build <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a> in June 2008 almost everyone
in the Perl community thought it is a waste of effort in a failed project to create something that no one wants.
</p>
<p>
After 1.5 year, over 50 releases, more than 10,000 commits by many contributors we can say Padre
is on its way to become one of the best editors for Perl 5 and Perl 6.
</p>
<p>
It would have not been possible without the growing support from the Perl
community and without the reuse of over 200 CPAN modules written by other people.
</p>
<p>
In this talk I'll talk about Padre and how we managed to build the team.
How we got included in all the major Linux distributions and what else have
we done to build the product?
</p>
<p>
Padre is a Perl IDE written in Perl 5. It provides special
features for editing both Perl 5 and Perl 6 files.
It is available on Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OSX.
</p>

An almost identical talk was given a month later at CeBIT. This time the organizers were not strict with
the time so I could finish all the slides:

<a name="distributing-cpan-packages"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Working with upstream - Distributing Perl modules from CPAN</p>
<p>(45 minutes)</p>
<p>This talk was given on <a href="http://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM 2010</a> in Brussels, Belgium
as scheduled <a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/events/dist_perl_cpan">here</a>
</p>
<p>
According to a report generated in 2007 less than 10% of the CPAN packages are redistributed
by Debian and Fedora and much less by the other distributions.
</p>
<p>
This is frustrating to the end user as they need to install many other packages directly from CPAN.
Because they already have to install from CPAN they don't care asking the distributors to include
those packages nor do they come and help packaging. Hence there are few packages....
</p>
<p>
In this session we will try to break the vicious cycle of the chicken and the egg and find
an improvement to the situation.
</p>

A lightning talk I gave at YAPC::NA 2012 in Madison, Wisconsin
</p>

<a name="refactoring-perl-code"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Refactoring Perl code</p>
<p>
Code refactoring is "disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior".
It is needed to ensure your code remains readable while growing in size and scope.
</p>
<p>
It is needed if you have some old code base that needs improvement and after every period of intense development when you
"did not have the time to properly design your code".
</p>
<p>
There are several patterns in refactoring, some of them you might already practice without knowing the name.
</p>
<p>
The most obvious is when you use a variable $x and suddenly you realize it could have a more descriptive name.
If you change all the occurances of $x to this better name, without changing anything else in the code, that's already refactoring.
</p>
<p>
We will see several patterns for refactoring Perl code. We see examples doing them manually and we'll try to automate them as well.
</p>

<a name="the-perl-testing-world"></a>
<p class="talk-title">Continuous integration of 20,000 libraries - the Perl Testing world</p>
<p>(60 minutes)</p>
<p>This talk is aimed at people who are either not yet familiar with the testing framework of
the Perl programming language and that of the CPAN - the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. The talk
does <b>not</b> requires previous experience with Perl, it can be easily followed by anyone with
a programming background who have already written buggy code.
</p>
<p>
In this talk I show how Perl programmers are making sure they can sleep well at night both before
and after major software releases.
</p>
<p>
In the first part of the talk I introduce the <a href="http://testanything.org/">Test Anything Protocol</a>
and the standard Perl libraries generating and parsing that output:
(<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/">Test::More</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness">Test::Harness</a>)
</p>
<p>
In the second part I show how the framework is used by the Perl and CPAN authors to ensure the
high quality of their code. How the reports are generated and how they are reported.
</p>
