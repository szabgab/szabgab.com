Version 0.19 of <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> 
was released <a href="http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/37973">two days ago</a>.

Today I finally uploaded a new version of Portable Strawberry Perl that includes Padre.
It is based on the same Beta 1 version of 
<a href="http://www.strawberryperl.com/">Portable Strawberry Perl for Windows</a> as was the 
previous version but this time it includes Padre 0.19.
