=head1 Perl wish list: fixing Pod::Tidy

=tags Perl, CPAN

=abstract start

I have a page one <a href="http://perlmaven.com/contributing-to-open-source-perl-ecosystem">Contributing to the Open Source Perl Ecosystem</a>,
but I still don't know where could I post my wish list of bug fixes that would find people with time and the drive to fix bugs.

=abstract end

I've just bumped into a <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=51281">bug</a> in <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod::Tidy">Pod::Tidy</a>.
The fix is also included in the bug report, but the module has not seen a new release from 6 years and the author did not have any activity on CPAN for
3, almost 4 years.

The bug prevent the installation of the module on OSX and possibly it also breaks its usage even if you install it without running the tests.

I don't have the time and energy to take over maintenance of the module, fix the issue and release it, but I am sure there are people out there who would
be happy to do that.

So it would be nice if there was some place for these wishes and for those people to meet.

<h2>Update: CPAN Adoption Candidates</h2>

Apparently there is a list of <a href="http://neilb.org/adoption/">CPAN modules waiting for Adoption</a> maintaine by, who else, Neil Bowers.
