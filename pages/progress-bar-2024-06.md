It is the 2024.06.14 and I would like to dump my current thought about the progress I made with the [Virtual Workshops](/virtual-workshops).

## Code-Mavens members

One of my "measureable goals" was to grow the number of members in the Meetup group, so let's see what's going on.

Number of members in the [Code-Mavens Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/):

| Date       | members | change   | daily |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
| 2024.05.21 | 2,681   |          |       |
| 2024.06.03 | 2,787   | 106 / 13 | 8.15  |
| 2024.06.14 | 2,915   | 128 / 11 | 11.63 |

My arbitrary expectation was 200 / 30 days = 6.6 / day increase. I am glad to see that, at least for now, it is is faster.


## Number of attendees on events

I was hoping to reach a 100 attendees - again an arbitrary number. In the first 3 events we were really far from that.

Number of people who registered to the events were 64 and 36 to two Rust-events and 64 to the Docker for Perl developers events.
The number of attendees was of course much lower, but what surprised me was that on the Perl event there were at least 25 people.
That was so far the biggest number of attendees.

| date       | title                                                  | registered | arrived |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| 2024.06.06 | Your first contribution to an Open Source Rust project |  64        |   15    |
| 2024.06.09 | Rust Maven Workshop: GitHub pages for Rust developers  |  36        |    8    |
| 2024.06.13 | Getting started with Docker for Perl developers        |  64        |   25    |


BTW The 100 came from the limit of Zoom, which is, I think not that important as I could also stream via YouTube and have an unlimited number of attendees there.
But we are far from that.
