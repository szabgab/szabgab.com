Yesterday I wrote <a href="/perception-is-reality--we-need-a-director-of-marketing.html">Perception is Reality - we need a director of marketing</a>.
After a few hours I was caught on IRC by some people who said the main problem
why companies are not picking Perl or why they are leaving Perl is 
that they cannot find
good Perl programmers. As reaching programmers to learn perl is not the job for 
a marketing director hence we don't need a marketing person.

Let's set aside all the other areas where professional marketing could help
the Perl world and let's focus on the issue of the impossibility to find 
good Perl programmers.

I think if we <b>compare it with Python, Ruby</b> and to some extent 
even with PHP the situation isn't better there either. 
I don't think it is a problem specific to Perl. 
On the other hand if you look at Java, people don't have the same 
problem. 

<b>Java does not have a lack of programmers</b>

There are several reasons for this. One of them is that most of the 
universities teach Java but not any of the dynamic languages.
The other reason is that in Perl/Python/Ruby they are looking for <b>good 
programmers</b> while in Java they are looking for 
<b>programmers</b>. I am not sure I know what they mean by that but that's
usually the phrasing I hear. The explanation I get sometimes is that
in Java you need one expert and you can get by with many beginners. In
dynamic languages you usually need a lot less people but they must be really 
good if you want maintainable code. This might be less so with Python and
Ruby but the difference is neglectable.

So <b>are Python and Ruby in better situation than Perl?</b>. If a company
or a team in a company decides to use one of the dynamic languages
they need to overcome the lack of Perl/Python/Ruby programmers. One of the
ways is to take some of the Java or C# programmers and teach them the language.  
Either by formal training or by letting them learn on their own.
In either case it requires an investment on the side of the company and the
willingness on the side of the programmer.
Perl has a clear disadvantage here that boils down to three issues.

<ul>
<li>It is harder to learn Perl than Python or Ruby</li>
<li>Perl is not as sexy as Python or Ruby</li>
<li>Team leaders and managers think about Perl that it is dead, unmaintainable,
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/39344">etc...</a></li>
</ul>

The first problem can be reduced or eliminated by improving Perl, the language
or by the various projects such as 
<a href="http://enlightenedperl.org/">Enlightened Perl</a>, 
<a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/">Modern Perl</a> or 
by creating <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">a really good IDE for Perl</a>.

The second issue might be also changed by the above improvements but that
is already mostly a question of perception.

The third issue is clearly something we programmers and system administrators
don't know how to deal with. There is where we need the professional help.
