=head1 Perl Poll: What would you like to read about?
=timestamp 1317037898
=tags Perl, poll, news, articles

I have set up a new web site for running polls, 
to allow people in the Perl community 
figure out what others in the community think.
I plan to run one very quick poll every month.

This time I'd like to know <a href="http://perlpolls.com/perl-news">what would you like to read about?</a>
in the Perl blogs.

As I don't want to drag these polls for a long time I'll give a very 
small window to fill them. Probably one week.

This time it is even shorter. You have less than 5 days to finish the <b>1-minute-long</b>
task answering 3 questions.

We can call this the <a href="http://perlpolls.com/perl-news">September 2011 Perl poll</a>.

It will end on 30 September at midnight.

<h2>Spread the word</h2>

That means I'll need <b>your help</b> in spreading the word to as many places as
you can and as quickly as you can.

Primarily, if you are subscribed to a <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> list then
send a mail with the link to either this blog post or directly to the poll.

If you are not yet subscribed, then what are you waiting for? I mean really? 
I'd like to know. So comment on this blog to let me know.

In addition an extremely great help would be to send it to your co-workers who 
are not subscribed to any Perl Monger lists and who are not reading any of the news sources.
Tell them to focus on what they might be interested reading about.

Don't worry about duplication. Some people might see this twice or even 3 times. They can easily ignore
the post. Or they can act on it. After all much research shows that only repeated view of 
the same information causes people to actually act on it. So repetition helps.

Ask them to go to the <a href="http://perlpolls.com/perl-news">Perl polls</a> site. Check a few boxes,
fill in the "other" fields if they like and press submit. That's it.
