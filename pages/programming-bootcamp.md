=abstract start

I've recorded the <a href="https://code-maven.com/programming-boootcamp-for-scientists">Programming Bootcamp for Scientists</a> video course
in September-October and used it as the material for a course. Finally I found a home for it where it will be easy to sell it
as a stand-alone course.

It is on Leanpub now: at <a href="https://leanpub.com/c/bootcamp">Programming Bootcamp</a>.

=abstract end

As a start I've enabled 13 out of the 42 videos, that's about 30% and I am giving a deep discount for the early birds.
Within a few days I am going to update the material and enable all of the videos and then the price will also be the
full price as you can see on the Leanpub site.

I am really glad I could do this as I wanted to be able to sell stand-alone courses.

Now that I know how to do the distribution and the sales I can go back and start recording other courses as well.
There are quite a few I am planning to record.
