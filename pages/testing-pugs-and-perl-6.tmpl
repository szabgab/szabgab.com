This is part of a series of articles I started with <a href="/quality-assurance-and-automated-testing-in-open-source-software.html">Quality Assurance and Automated Testing in Open Source Software</a>.

Pugs is the implementation of Perl 6 in Haskell.

In order to build it one will need the most recent version of ghc 
(<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a>),
currently 6.6.1.

<h2>Development and Testing</h2>

The developers use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> 
and <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/">SVK</a> as version control.
The mode of development is very <i>anarchistic</i> as the lead developer
puts it. They do a lot of TD - Test first Development, meaning in most 
cases they write unit tests before implementing features. This provides
a very good test coverage of Perl 6 and the Pugs project.

Tests can be found in the t/
subdirectory of the source tree. 
They are written mostly in Perl 6 with some of them being in Perl 5.

There are more than 100 developers in the project, though most of 
them are not always active.

Most of the communication is done via an IRC channel.
Even the commit messages of the version control system appear 
on the #perl6 IRC channel.

Building Pugs is simple (once you have Haskell installed):

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    
The test can be executed using

    $ make test

<h2>Automated Testing</h2>

People can setup and schedule smoke tests freely.
They need to have the above environment and also install
[dist://Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix] and then run something like this:

    svn up
    make clean
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make smoke

This will run the tests and upload the report to the smoke
server. Then people can see the reports on the
smoke test status.

There is a file called smoker-example.yml in the util/ subdirectory.
Based on that file you can create a smoker.yml either in the Pugs home
directory or in your users home directory.
This file <i>can</i> contain identification information about you.
IMHO it is a good idea to include at least an e-mail here so developers
can contact you in case you reports seem to be strange.

As the testing tools and reporting system is very similar, look at
<a href="/smoked-parrot.html">Smoked Parrot</a> for more details.
