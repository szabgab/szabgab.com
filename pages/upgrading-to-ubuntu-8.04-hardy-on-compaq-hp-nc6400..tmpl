=head1 Upgrading to Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy on Compaq (HP) nc6400.

I am not sure if I am brave or stupid. I had an almost perfectly working
notebook running Ubuntu 7.10 but now that 8.04 has been out for more than
a month I decided to upgrade.

Actually if I am looking at from the right angle than the upgrade was quite
smooth. Though I am not what advantages I am going to have - this version 
still uses perl 5.8.8 - but most of the system seems to be working.

A couple of issues:

The screen resolution got corrupted but after running the configuration tool
Preferences/Screen Resolution and setting it to 1280x800 both my regular
notebook screen and my external screen came back to their normal malfunction.
I mean the regular screen is ok, but I am still missing the bottom 1.5 row from
the external screen. That's especially inconvenient when using gvim in 
full screen mode...

The other problem with the resolution is that when showing the login screen
Ubuntu thinks I have a 44" or maybe even 50" monitor. So the login prompt
is not on the screen and I only see the upper left part of the Ubuntu logo.

Maybe I missed the advertisement that says this version comes with a 
larger monitor...

Another issue is wifi. The little icon on the upper panel does not
show the available wireless networks any more. I was told that I can
configure specific networks manually but hey, this used to work just
a few days ago... Can I get it back please?

I checked if my slide generation tools are still working and they are,
so that's ok.

Oh but <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a> stopped 
working as Firefox was 
upgraded to 3 beta 5 and Selenium only supports Firefox 2. 
I tried Konqueror but with no luck so
far. I also tried to install Firefox 2 and create a separate profile for
it but so far I could not get either of those working with Selenium.
