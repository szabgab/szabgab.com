=head1 The most popular sites about JavaScript in 2014
=timestamp 1420545991
=tags JavaScript, Alexa



In January 2014 I've published an article about the <a href="/the-popularity-of-perl-in-2013.html">popularity of Perl in 2013</a>.
This time I've created a number of separate pages for dynamic programming languages.
This page covers sites that have JavaScript as their primary focus.



As I don't have access to the logs of these sites, the second best approach is to look at the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> ranking of the sites.
While it is far from being perfect, it seems to have a strong <a href="/meaning-of-alexa-rankings.html">correllation to what Google Analytics reports</a>
for some other sites.

A few of the sites also have the ranking from previous years, but most of the sites were added only now.

Next year, when we'll be able to see how specific sites have moved will be much more interesting.

So if you'd like to add a site, send <a href="/about.html">me</a> the URL.
