=abstract start

In January 2014 I've published an article about the <a href="/the-popularity-of-perl-in-2013.html">popularity of Perl in 2013</a>.
This year I've created several pages for a number of dynamic programming languages. I am adding one for Dart as well, even though it
seems that after all it has not managed to get tracktion.

=abstract end

As I don't have access to the logs of these sites, the second best approach is to look at the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> ranking of the sites.
While it is far from being perfect, it seems to have a strong <a href="/meaning-of-alexa-rankings.html">correllation to what Google Analytics reports</a>.

If I have missed a site, that you think is important, please let me know!
