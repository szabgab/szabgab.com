I already mentioned twice that I'd like to make a point linking
to people who write about Padre (see [Padre blogs](/padre-blogs) and [More Padre blogs](/more-padre-blogs))
but in the end it just boils down to what the title says.

Anyway two more links:
Recently [Steffen Mueller](http://use.perl.org/~tsee/journal/)
wrote [How Padre saved my day](http://use.perl.org/~tsee/journal/38714)
and [Jeremiah Foster](http://blog.jeremiahfoster.com/) wrote about the
Test Automation Training and the Perl 6 training I am going to give in Oslo.
