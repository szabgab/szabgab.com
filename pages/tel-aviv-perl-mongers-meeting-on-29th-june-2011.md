The next meeting of the <a href="http://telaviv.pm.org/">Tel Aviv Perl Mongers</a>
will take place on 29th June in the Shenkar College. 
For detailed address see the web site.

We meet at 6:30pm, and talks begin at 7:00pm.

After the technical meeting we plan to go to a restaurant to build 
our off-line social network.

The agenda is as follows:

<h2>Scraping A Cookbook by ynon perek</h2>

I recently got a chance to convert a 
<a href="http://anonymous.org.il/">live web site</a> into an iPhone app. 

The process involved deciding which parts will go into the app, how it will look, and
scraping the content to an SQLite db that was to be deployed on the
iPhone (along with an app).

In the talk, I will present some of the perls I used to get/convert
the textual and image data, and use them to talk about XPath, DOM and
SAX for digging the "right" data.

Duration: 40 minutes

<h2>#myjourneytoperl - graphing a meme by Dotan Dimet</h2>

On March 30th, at the urging of Matt Trout, perl people on
Twitter posted text graphs showing their path to Perl from and through
other programming languages. Inspired by the directed graph format used,
I decided to capture these posts and combine them into a single giant
graph which I would render using the graphviz toolkit. I'll talk about
the tools I used (Mojolicious, GraphViz, the twitter JSON api), the
problems I encountered (Unicode!) and the snapshot of the Perl community
that emerged.

Duration: 15 minutes

<h2>Writing a blog engine in 15 minutes by Gabor Szabo</h2>

We will create a single-user blog engine based on 
<a href="http://perldancer.org/">Dancer</a>.

It will be especially easy for people who are using Windows 
as they can download a single package that has everything they need.

Duration: 15 minutes
