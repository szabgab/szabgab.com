=head1 Rust ðŸ¦€ version 1.83.0 came out a few days ago. It is upgrade time!
=timestamp 1733301024
=tags rust, testing


This means we have a new and probably stricter version of Clippy, the built-in linter.

This means I am now going over the 764 examples I have in my Rust course, the 100 or examples I have on the Rust ðŸ¦€ Maven web site, and the Rust projects I have been developing.

I go over them to make sure they still pass their tests and still abide by all the rules. (or at least the ones that I have opted out from)

Luckily this is done mostly automatically thanks to the hashtag#automated tools, the unit-tests, and the CI system I added ahead of time.

Did I already mention that hashtag#testing, especially automated testing makes upgrading a much safer task? Regardless if I change the operating system, a library or my compiler.
