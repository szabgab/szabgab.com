## What do people say?

> If you're interested at all in why I chose to financially support you,
> it's because of how often your name comes up with excellent answers to
> Perl questions I have googled for over the years.
> You have been tremendously helpful.
**~ one of my supporters**

> Thanks for all that you do. I maintain a Perl code base, and have repeatedly relied on your excellent writing and documentation.
**~ another supporter**

> I am an avid reader of your Perl Weekly and Perl Maven articles.
**~ yet another supporter**

> Why I support you? Because you spend a lot of time and effort writing Perl Weekly and Perl Maven content, documentation etc,
> answering Perl questions in various places, and just generally appear to care a lot for the Perl community, which I care for deeply too.

Core developer of the [Perl Dancer](https://perldancer.org/) project.


> In any case, thanks for both your service and support to the Perl community with the Perl Weekly newsletter.
> A lot of my success in my job is due to my use of Perl, so I'm happy to give back to the community.
