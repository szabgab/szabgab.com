Many of us in the Perl community like talking to people, showing the latest project we have been working on.
We like it especially if it also involves drinking some beer or other "beverages".

I've starter collecting events around the world where Perl mongers could go, talk about Perl with 
other Perl mongers or with people who rarely hear about it and talk about Perl. This time I present the list of events for May 2010.

Hopefully the smoke will settle down soon and the <a href="http://npw2010.fsfi.is/">Nordic Perl Workshop</a> will take place 
smoothly in Reykjavik, Iceland between 1-2 May. Due to family commitments I won't be able to attend even 
though I really wanted to visit Iceland but as I read Salve J. Nilsen will represent the [dist://Perl::Staff] there.

The <a href="http://www.linuxwochen.at/">Linux Wochen (Linux Weeks)</a> is a series of events throughout Austria.
Between 6-8 May it will be held in Vienna. I think this is a great opportunity to meet people and talk about Perl
and the new techniques available in Perl. While due to a training class I won't be able to attend I hope the friendly 
<a href="http://vienna.pm.org/">Perl Mongers in Vienna</a> that 
also organised the <a href="http://2010.qa-hackathon.org/qa2010/">QA Hackathon</a> last week will get together and setup a booth
there. Actually there are a few other Linux Wochen events in April that could be visited to see how such thing work and what to expect.

On 13-14 May, <a href="http://www.bsdcan.org/2010/">BSDCan - The BSD Conference</a> will take place in Ottawa, Canada.
I would be really interested to know if there are any Perl developers who are planning to attend the conference. Please
<a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>.

Between 25-28 May the <a href="http://www.guug.de/veranstaltungen/ffg2010/">GUUG-Frühjahrsfachgespräch 2010</a> (The spring meeting of the German Unix User Group) 
will take place in Köln, Germany. Any Perl monger planning to attend?


<h2>Calendar</h2>

I'll keep posting the evens for the coming months but I've also setup a Google <a href="/events.html">calendar of events interesting for Perl mongers</a> 
that could be attended by folks that want to talk a bit about Perl.

If you know about any other interesting event, please let me know so I can include it in the calendar and might be able
to write about a bit here.
