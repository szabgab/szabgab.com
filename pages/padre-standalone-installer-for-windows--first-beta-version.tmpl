<a href="http://csjewell.dreamwidth.org/">Curtis Jewell</a> 
has <a href="http://csjewell.dreamwidth.org/802.html">already announced</a> 
it on his own blog but as he said his blog is hardly read and is not included 
in the various Perl blog aggregators
I promised to also write about it and link to his post.

so the first beta version of the stand-alone Padre msi installer is ready. It still is only 
an enlarged version of Strawberry Perl so it install in c:\strawberry but it is a huge
step in the direction of making it easily available to the general public of Windows users.

So if you have a windows box, go ahead, 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Download">download Padre</a> and tell us about it
via the standard channels of <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>
