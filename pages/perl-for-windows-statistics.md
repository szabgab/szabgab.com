<a href="http://ali.as/">Adam Kennedy</a> pointed me to the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/strawberry-perl/downloads/list?can=1&q=&sort=uploaded&colspec=Filename%20Summary%20Uploaded%20Size%20DownloadCount">download count of Strawberry Perl for Windows</a>.
this shows that in the last 3 months there were approximately 54K downloads of 5.10.x and 4.5K downloads of 5.8.x That would be about 650 downloads a day.

Back on 7/7/2007 Jan Dubois <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl5-porters/3521207">mentioned</a>
that <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> has more than 4,500 downloads of ActivePerl 5.8.x per day for Windows
and more than 1,000 downloads of ActivePerl 5.6.1 per day.

Unfortunately I don't have newer numbers from ActiveState but it would be interesting to see how have the numbers
changed? Also it would be nice if we had numbers from the other Perl distributions for Windows.
