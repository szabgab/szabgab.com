It was just a month ago that I wrote <a href="/compare-languages-by-usage.html">Compare Languages by usage</a>.

That was the time when I opened
<a href="https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/szabgab">my Ohloh account</a>
and registered the <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/projects/padre/">Padre project</a>.

I listed myself as the first user of Padre.

Today, just a month later there are already 10 users. 
As anyone dealing with marketing knows this a good opportunity to show how
well the project does.
A 10-fold monthly growth rate  means that in a year we'll have 
exactly 1,000,000,000,000 users. (=10**12).


Disclaimer: I barely passed my Marketing exam when I studied for MBA.
The only course I got worse marks was, you guess, statistics.
