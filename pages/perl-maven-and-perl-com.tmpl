=head1 Perl Maven under 200,000 and ahead of Perl.com
=timestamp 1388644529
=tags Perl, Alexa

While I know the rankings <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> provides are only proxymations to the actual popularity of each site,
and I think even they take it seriously only for the first 100,000 sites,
but this is the best I can have. Without actually seeing the logs or the Google Analytics of other sites.

Anyway, this is mostly just a fun look at some random numbers.

On 24 December 2013, for the first time <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a>
ranked higher than <a href="http://perl.com" rel="nofollow">perl.com</a>.
The <a href="http://perlmeme.com/" rel="nofollow">Perl Meme</a> site was still a bit ahead.

Two days later, even that was passed. I even recorded the position of these 3 sites the few days around the event. Just to see the fluctuation.
I think the margin of error of Alexa can be at least 10%, even for
sites with similar audience. So these differences are quite meaningless.

After publishing the initial numbers, I kept looking at the Alexa ranking every day and so you can see these number for the
3 Perl-related sites around 200,000.
