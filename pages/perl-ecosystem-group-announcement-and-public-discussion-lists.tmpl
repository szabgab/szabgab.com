=head1 Perl Ecosystem Group announcement and public discussion lists

=tags Perl, PEG, ecosystem, news, discussion

As we are trying to further increase the interaction between the Open Source 
Perl Community and the companies using Perl we have setup two new public 
mailing lists.

On one of them we are going to send out <a href="http://mail.perl-ecosystem.org/mailman/listinfo/peg-news">news and announcements</a>.
The other was setup to <a href="http://mail.perl-ecosystem.org/mailman/listinfo/peg-public">let people discuss</a> 
in public their expectations from the Perl Ecosystem Group.

Of course such discussion is not restricted to our mailing list and I'd be happy to get 
comments here or on your own blog. 
What do you expect from the <a href="http://perl-ecosystem.org/">Perl Ecosystem Group</a>?
