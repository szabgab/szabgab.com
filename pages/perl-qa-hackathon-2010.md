The <a href="http://qa-hackathon.org/">Perl QA-Hackathon</a> in 
<a href="http://2010.qa-hackathon.org/qa2010/">Vienna</a> just starter a few hours ago. Most of the 
people actually arrived yesterday and we met in the near-by <a href="http://centimeter.at/">Centimeter</a>
where <a href="http://centimeter.at/wos_is_des.htm">ate and drank</a> quite well as you can see.

Already at the breakfast table I got some really good ideas from the other people implementing 
<a href="http://mail.perlide.org/pipermail/padre-dev/2010-April/001724.html">a wysiwyg-like feature</a> 
for <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>.

At the Hackathon itself first people introduced themselves and said a few words about the projects 
they are planning to work on. 
Personally I have two unrelated issues. I'd like to play with the new 
<a href="http://www.archos.com/products/imt/archos_5it/index.html">Archos 5 internet tablet</a> that runs
<a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> and see how can I put Perl on it and how can I use the 
Perl on it for testing other applications. I started to collect some information and links 
on <a href="">Perl on Android</a>.

The other project is about a tool to allow
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2010/04/writing-tests-by-non-programmers.html">writing tests by non-programmers</a>.
I'd like to move this forward and get help from the other people here both in the concept and in implementing 
some of the features. I explained the idea to Ovid who directed me to this video 
about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClH9xCs3q4I">literate functional testing</a>.
