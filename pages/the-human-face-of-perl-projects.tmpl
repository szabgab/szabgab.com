Some Perl projects show you the faces of their community: 
you can see the people behind <a href="http://www.webgui.org/promote/the-people-behind-wg">WebGUI</a>
or profiles of the current <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/developers/profiles.html">Bugzilla</a> developers.
<a href="http://www.foswiki.org/Development/CurrentActiveDevelopers">Foswiki</a> also has a page for currently active developers
or you can see the <a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org/about/team/">Bricolage</a> team or 
the <a href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/site/staff.bml">Dreamwidth</a> people.  Padre has a page for 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/developers.html">developers</a> and an additional one for 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/translators.html">translators</a>.

Do you know about similar pages of other Perl projects?

Based on the comments:

I am not sure why I have forgotten to add <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.CPAN.org</a> where you can see the faces of many authors.
There is also the <i>who</i> page of the <a href="http://london.pm.org/who/">London Perl Mongers</a>.
