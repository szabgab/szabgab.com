=head1 Wasting time on Facebook

In the past few weeks I've noticed that way too many times I visit Facebook and waste a lot of time there.

Again.

It happens when I get bored.

When a task is too difficult to do and I'd like to "relax". (In reality just procrastinate.)

When I wait for a build or test process to finish.

...



I went back to my old solution and edited the <b>/etc/hosts</b> file on my Linux box
adding the following two lines:

<code>
127.0.0.1 facebook.com
127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com
</code>

Now every time I type in facebook.com in my browser it gives me an error page.

It would not be difficult to remove those two lines every time I would like to just "browse a bit",
but this extra step used to be enough to deter me from visiting it and wasting time.


<h2>Improved solution</h2>

I also have an idea for even better deterrence, to create a page that will be served instead of facebook
that might display some fun text and count the number of times I visit the page.
