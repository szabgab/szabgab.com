A month ago there was a discussion on
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2008/10/msg6992.html">module-authors</a>
about the licensing issues of CPAN modules, especially the license field in META.yml.

As reported in <a href="/licenses-in-meta.yml-on-cpan.html">Licenses in META.yml on CPAN</a>, on
22 October 2008 there were 10,235 CPAN modules without a license fields in META.yml.
Today, there are 10,264 such modules.

Is there a bug in the way 
<a href="http://cpants.perl.org/dist/shortcoming?metric=metayml_has_license">CPANTS</a>
is looking at the issue? If so please report it.
