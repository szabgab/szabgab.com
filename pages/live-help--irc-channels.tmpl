In the last month or two some of us got really enthusiastic about the 
<a href="http://www.mibbit.com/">Mibbit</a> service and how it can be a
relatively easy way to direct more people to the IRC channels where
we can provide quick help. I got so enthusiastic that I wrote a blog post
( <a href="/what-is-the-last-element-of-an-infinite-list-or-how-to-get-started-with-perl-6.html">What is the last element of an infinite list or how to get started with Perl 6 ?</a> ) trying to direct people interested in Perl 6 to 
use that service. 
<a href="http://ali.as/">Adam Kennedy</a> wrote about how we added 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/39042">"Live support" to Padre</a>.
Two days ago I even added an icon to the <a href="http://www.strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl for Windows</a>
distribution that will open a browser to Mibbit to join the #win32 IRC channel.

Then yesterday <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> has 
<a href="http://blog.freenode.net/2009/06/new-freenode-webchat-and-why-to-use-it/">shut</a> 
<a href="http://blog.mibbit.com/?p=306">down</a> the access to its service using the
Mibbit web IRC client and offered their own <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat</a>.

That's bad. Not only do I have to fix my blog entry - which is easy but disturbing - but 
it also means all the current users of Padre 0.35 have a broken "Live Service" link in their
application. Luckily, there are not many such people.

So we have to fix the link in <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> and
release a new version. that of course is not enough as I would like to avoid another 
such event so instead of pointing to an external service we are going to point to a 
web page on our site that will do the redirection automatically. It can even provide us
with another chance to explain what is waiting for the un-expecting user. 
That way if the URLs change or services get shut down
we only need to update a page on our web site and the users won't need to know about the change.

So I started to build a page in JavaScript that will redirect the users to the relevant web 
based IRC channel. I added a few channels that were listed on 
<a href="http://www.irc.perl.org/channels.mhtml">irc.perl.org</a> and a few that were not.
I am sure there are lots of other Perl related channels out there that could be added
to the list. Especially I am interested in locale specific channels so we will
be able to direct the Italian speaking users to the Italian IRC channel.

Please check out this page that I now call the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/irc.html">Perl IRC Jumper</a>.
By looking at the source you can see the list of all the channels we currently have.
If you know about other channels that you'd like to see there, either post a response here
or drop by the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/irc.html?channel=padre">#padre channel</a> and
let me know what else to add.
