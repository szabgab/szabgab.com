I really have no energy to write much. The first day of CeBIT was a bit low on visitors but even that went quite well. 
I met with several people I wanted to talk. Especially interesting were the chats with the people from the Eclipse Foundation.

Today, on the second day, was a lot busier. Many people were walking around and many people came to the Perl stand as well. 
There are always 3-4 [dist://Perl::Staff] people at the stand and usually they are busy talking to visitors.

Some PHP and Ruby developers came and we could show them interesting things that can be done with 
Perl, <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a>, <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> 
and [dist://DBIx::Class]. Many people also liked Padre, you know <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">the Perl IDE</a>

There were many people who said that the main problem they are facing is the lack of Perl developers and some 
of them told us that they are actually considering switching language because of this. It seems to them that it is 
easy to find programmers to many other languages, something that was the case with Perl as well a few year ago but now
there don't seem to be any Perl programmers. I wonder what could be the reason of that? Where are does developers gone?
Have they stopped using Perl and have they remove Perl from their CV? Are there many more jobs now filled by those developers 
without new developers learning Perl to fill the newly created jobs?
Maybe the expectations from a Perl developer are now higher than 5-10 years ago so the same people who could counted as 
Perl developers 5 years ago aren't considered as such any more?

Anyway we have a lot more work to do in the coming days. I'll try to add some pictures to the next report.
