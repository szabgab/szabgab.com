=timestamp 1498027091
=tags Crowdfunding, Perl, Bailador



Finally I had some time to work on <a href="https://leanpub.com/bailador">the Bailador book</a> and made the following changes:

<ul>
<li>Added first section of the Ajax code in Chapter 7.</li>
<li>Added first section about using SQLite in Chapter 3.</li>
<li>Added instructions to use Vagrant with Ubuntu in Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>

Given that <a href="http://perl6maven.com/book">the campaign</a> won't reach its original goal you might have
been wondering what will you get if you back the book? I've been
wondering that myself. So let me clarify, that indeed you are going to
get all the chapters of the book as outlined on the campaign page.

But why should you join the 125 people who have already supported the
book instead of waiting for it till it is finished in December?

Because this way you can either get a deep discount ($25 instead of
$55), or you can gain early access to the book that will give an
advantage over those who buy it later. (And still get $5 discount.)

You will also be mentioned in the book among the supporters and trust
me, it is a great feeling.

So don't miss the deadline, <a href="http://perl6maven.com/book">support the book now!</a>
