I am subscribed to <a href="https://opensource.com/">Open Source.com newsletter</a>.
The other day, in their message there were two articles included I wanted to put in my public bookmarking.

Unfortunately I don't have a public bookmark system.



So I kept the e-mail around till I write one. I've already looked at this e-mail 3 or 4 times, and every
time I had the urge to start writing this application I want so much. This web application that would
allow me to write my blog entries. That would allow me to have both public and private bookmarks.
Something where I could post both long articles, and short, even Tweatable, statuses that could the
automatically be posted on my Twitter or Facebook account.

Something in Perl.

Every time when I have the urge to start building this, it takes some effort to remind myself that this is a big project
and I am already in the <a href="http://tracert.com/">middle</a> of <a href="https://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org">several</a>,
<a href="https://perlmaven.com/testing">big</a> <a href="https://code-maven.com/">projects</a>
and maybe I should finish one of them before starting a new one.


But this e-mail is still in my in-box. I don't want to delete it. I don't want to file it away. I just would like to
put the links from that e-mail on my public bookmarking system.

Which I sill don't have.

Last chance for sanity. I just write this down, and put the links here listing a number of missing Perl projects:
