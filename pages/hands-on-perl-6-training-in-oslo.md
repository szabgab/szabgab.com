Details about the free one-day Perl 6 training I am giving in Oslo, Norway
on 18th April 2009.



The <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009/">Nordic Perl Workshop</a>
that will take place between 16-17 April 2009 will include two major 
threads of talks. One about 
<a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009/talks#87">Modern Perl Ways</a> the
other is about the 
<a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009/talks#86">Future with Rakudo and Parrot</a>.

That means people attending the workshop will be able to learn a lot about Perl 6
but they won't really have time to practice.
So in order to provide them with a good environment, on Saturday, 18th April, 
the day after the workshop, I am going to provide a one day Perl 6 
hands on training. It is based on my emerging 
<a href="/perl6.html">Perl 6 training material</a> but it will be mostly
hands-on.

Let's see what is the content:

First we are going to setup our environment:
<ul>
<li>Setting up <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> and <a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> to be able to run Perl 6
<li>Setting up <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> with the Perl 6 plug-in so we have a partial IDE for Perl 6
</ul>

Then we go over the basic use of Perl 6 and how it differs from Perl 5.
<ul>
<li>Scalars
<li>Basic I/O
<li>Dealing with Files (I/O)
<li>Control Structures (loops, conditionals)
<li>Chained comparison
<li>Lists and Arrays
<li>Hashes
<li>Subroutines, Multi dispatch subroutines, signatures
<li>Junctions
<li>Regexes
<li>Grammars
<li>Classes
<li>Meta operators
</ul>

There will be exercises the participants can solve, 
with my help when necessary.

While I'll give frontal explanations, the biggest part of the 
time will be spent experimenting with Perl 6 programming.

If you are attending the training, at the end of the day you
will be able to write simple applications in Perl 6.

While in most of the cases you'll feel that you can still 
code in Perl 5 faster than in Perl 6 - after all 
you have been using it for many years - there already will
be cases when you prefer to write stuff in Perl 6 as that 
will save you time and headache!

This training is free of charge. The number of participants
is limited to 12 and we allocate places on a first come first served
basis among people who have registered
to the <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009">Nordic Perl Workshop</a>,
after any sponsors and organizers of the NPW had their opportunity
to register.

So if you'd like to participate first register on the workshop,
arrange payment of the workshop and then send me an e-mail 
with a link to your registration on the workshop web site.
