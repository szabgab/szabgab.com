=head1 Blogging about Perl outside the community?

I read the suggestions of
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=676216">chromatic</a> to write about the
projects we do and then post them on <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> and
<a href="http://digg.com/">digg.com</a> and similar places.
Actually I think I already read these suggestions a few month ago.
So I signed up on both Technorati and on digg.com.

Then I looked around to see what content is there which might be related to Perl.
One of the first hit on digg.com was the link to the Perlmonks node
<a href="http://digg.com/programming/The_Perl_Hacker_Inferiority_Complex">The Perl Hacker Inferiority Complex</a>

I read the comments and it was plain sad. Full of nonsense coming out mainly from people
who seem to be Python programmers. Lots of hatred too.

Do I really need this?
Even on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">Perlmonks</a> a few month ago there was a troll
who posted stupid and offending comments to nearly any post or comment. After some time it went
away but it was very annoying.

I would not be surprised if many Perl programmers would rather not post anything on
these forums just to avoid such comments. I for one get quite discouraged.


Anyway I posted another Perlmonks node on digg.com:
<a href="http://digg.com/programming/What_can_bring_the_excitement_back_to_Perl">What can bring the excitement back to Perl</a>
and an article on PerlBuzz:
<a href="http://digg.com/programming/Good_Perl_code_is_the_best_form_of_evangelism">Good Perl code is the best form of
evangelism</a>

We'll see if generates the same stupid reaction.
