As I can see that Hans Jeuken has not touched his modules 
for a while and [dist://Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate] has a few
issues - most notably that it needs a small patch to work at all -
I'd like to take over maintaining that module.

I sent him a mail over 2 weeks ago with no response. 
If you know him, could you please contact him so I can get 
his blessing?
