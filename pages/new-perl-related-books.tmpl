On my Google alert feed I just saw two recently published books mentioned for two different fields. They both 
use Perl as the language of solution. The two books are
<a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430224495">Linux System Administration Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach</a>
and
<a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470414642.html">Developing Web Applications with Apache, MySQL, memcached, and Perl</a>
