It is not the first time I was thinking about creating a platform for organizing meetings, but this time I have a plan and started to work on it.

After many weeks of "research", that is, learning more Rust and writing [almost 100 articles about Rust](/rust-maven-100), and then after 2 days of
actual coding (and doing more research), yesterday I finally published the first version of [Meet-OS](https://meet-os.com/).



The fun part was that I wanted it to be included in the January 03 edition of [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/), so I had to have a working
web site yesterday afternoon.

This forced me reduce the scope of the first version. I hard-coded lots of things and the site does not even have a registration system yet, but it already shows the
[Rust Maven group](https://meet-os.com/group/1) and the first event: [Web development with Rocket](https://meet-os.com/event/1).
I even figured out that people who are interested in this even could follow the [issue](https://github.com/szabgab/meetings.rs/issues/3) that asks for the registration system.

Then, of course, I realized there will be very few people noticing the event, so I'll have to promote it in other channels, but it was still a good way to motivate myself.

In the next few days I need to implement the registration and then I can start promoting the first even on some other channels as well.
