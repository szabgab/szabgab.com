Filling out the [YAPC::Europe 2011 survey](http://ye2011.yapc-surveys.org/)
that [Barbie](http://www.missbarbell.co.uk/) runs every year was a shocking experience. Again.

I saw lots of talks I wanted to attend but missed. I saw names of speakers I wanted to meet but have not.

It is the same every year.

I go to [YAPC](http://yapceurope.org/). Go to good talks. Talk to a lot of good people.
In the end I find out there were a lot of other good talks I missed and a lot of
people I have not talked to, during the even.

## YAPC is great

This year was not an exception either. It is a very good opportunity
to meet new people and catch up with old friends. Even if I miss some others during the event.

Luckily there are many reports written by the attendees. There were a number of reports
coming out during and right after the conference but for some reason a few more showed
up in the last couple of days.

I feel these are very important posts. I can read how others saw the event and it provides
a way for people who have not attended to see what went on.

It can also provide a tool for the organizers of upcoming events to show
potential visitors what can they expect.

Let me link here to all the reports I found. If I missed some, please let me know!
I'd be glad to link to all of them.
