One of the "findings" of my [previous question](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ital1t/why_dont_you_use_rust_at_your_company/) was that some crates are missing or not mature enough to be used.

If you would like to use Rust you can hope that those gaps will be closed in time or you can do something about it. If you have the time and expertise you can get involved in the needed projects, but there is a much easier and less time-consuming way. You and/or your company can sponsor the development efforts.

Allocating 10-20 USD / month by an individual or 1000-2000 USD  month by a small company does not sound like a huge investment and many such sponsors can make a huge difference.

One can either sponsor [The Rust Foundation](https://rustfoundation.org/) or the individual developers or projects. The latter can be done via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/).

One way to find who to sponsor is to find the developers of your currently dependencies. For that visit the [Explore GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/explore)
page. On the left-hand side select the "Cargo" ecosystem. That will show you the individuals and the organizations that you currently rely upon that also accept sponsorship.

I've also created a page listing some of the [people and project](https://rust.code-maven.com/sponsoring) who develop Rust and could be sponsored.
For some of them I've also included background information.
