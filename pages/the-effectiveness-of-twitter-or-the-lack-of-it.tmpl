=head1 The effectiveness of Twitter, or the lack of it

I have almost 600 followers on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/szabgab">Twitter</a> but when I 
tweet with a link only about 10-20 people click on the links. There was one link that was clicked
70 times but only because it was re-tweeted by several people.

So either I am exceptionally bad linker or that's it. In normal case only 2-3% of your 
followers will read and click on your links.

Of course if I think of it, I am not sure I click on more than 2% of the links 
I see on twitter. On many days I can't even go over all the tweets I am following.

So to improve on the situation I try to stick to my core subjects 
- it does not always work - and tweet only about those.

How do you use twitter?
