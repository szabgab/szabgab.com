After <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2008/03/msg6330.html">I posted</a>
the above note (<a href="/license-of-perl-modules-on-cpan.html">License of Perl Modules on CPAN</a>)
on the <a href="http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=module-authors">module-authors</a>
mailing list I got a quick reply from David Landgren telling me that it has been there for several
years now.

Wow. If that's true, and I checked in 6.31, the oldest version of MakeMaker currently available
of CPAN and it was already in the docs back in October 2006, then why are there still so many modules
on CPAN without a proper license field in their META.yml file?

<a href="http://cpants.perl.org/">CPANTS</a> says there are currently 9920 distributions
without a license field in the META.yml file. (Out of the 13222 or so distributions.)
