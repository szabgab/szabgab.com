I few days ago I read an article on dev.to on <a href="https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/how-to-make-money-with-your-content-1c7i">how to monetize web content</a>.
As I understand it is based a standard called <a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Webmonetization</a>.



I asked both in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/jvpgme/funds_for_tpf_by_the_readers_of_metacpan_using/">Reddit /r/perl</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/permalink/3761901847175909/">Perl programmers Facebook group</a> what the folks think
about using such a system on <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> and other <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/">TPF</a> associated sites
to get some funds for The Perl Foundation.

I did not get any comment in Reddit. The post in Facebook generated some technical discussion, but I have not received any input I could really use to decide if this would be a good idea
for any of those sites or if it would be a good idea for myself on my own sites.

In any case this is an interesting topic to check back later on.
