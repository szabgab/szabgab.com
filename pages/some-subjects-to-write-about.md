This is mostly just a note to myself.

The main languages I work these days are Rust, Python, a little-bit of Perl.

The main topics I work these days are: testing, CI, Docker, web applications, command line applications. I should also look more into networking applications and embedded software.

I started to write about [improving the development process](/improving-the-development-process). I already have a few ideas for additional articles:

* How to speed up development by writing tests?
* How to increase employee-satisfaction by writing tests?
* How to reduce turnover by introducing fast feedback loop in the development process? (writing tests / using CI)
* How to reduce risks to the business by introducing test automation / CI?
* How to speed up development by introducing fast feedback loops.


* Using the command line.
* How can people learn better - how do I teach to make it better.
* Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment / Continuous Delivery.
* Testing in production.
* TDD.
* BDD.
* Agile ideas.
* Blue-Green deployment.
* Personalized deployment.
* Clean code.

* Move from Python 2 to Python 3
* Introduce Rust replacing some part of the system to make the code faster and more secure.


I guess there are tons of topics I can write about that are related to what I do, what I teach.

What I should probably remember in my posts is to always somehow connect it to the services I offer.
Helping to improve the development process, learn Python, learn Rust. Move over from other languages to these languages.
