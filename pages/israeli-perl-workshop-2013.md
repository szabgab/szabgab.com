=tags Perl, Israel, 2013, Workshop



This year we were a bit in stealth mode with the organization of the <a href="http://act.perl.org.il/">Israeli Perl
Workshop</a>, but it is not late to talk about it a bit.

The workshop will take place on February 25, 2013 in the <a href="http://www.shenkar.ac.il/">Shenkar College</a> in Ramat Gan.

The <a href="http://act.perl.org.il/ilpw2013/schedule">schedule of the workshop</a> is finally available.
19 talks in two tracks.



The full price is 190 NIS, but with the early-bird discount you can get in for 90 NIS.
That is less than a ticket to the movies with pop-corn!

And you get a <a href="http://www.buddhaburgers.co.il/">vegan lunch</a> at the Perl Workshop!

It was surprisingly tasty last year.

Besides the regular intermediate-advanced Perl talks, this year we are going to have two set
of other, interesting talks. Let me point out a few of them:
