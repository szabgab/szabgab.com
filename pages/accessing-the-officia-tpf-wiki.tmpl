Once upon a time <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> had a 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5">wiki</a> using an 
old, and still open source version of the <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">Socialtext</a> software.
It had issues. It was old. No one had the know-how or the tuits to maintain it.

Then in the summer of 2010 it was arranged that the content of the wiki will be moved to a free (as in free beer)
but not open source version of <a href="https://www.socialtext.net/">Socialtext</a>, maintained by 
the company producing the application.

This meant the URLs now are that of <a href="https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/perl_5_wiki">socialtext.net</a>.

I see several problems with this - for example this is a branding issue. The wiki can no longer seen as the
official TPF wiki. In addition now we - as in the community - have totally lost control over the wiki.

<a href="http://www.perlsofwisdom.net/2011/01/perl-wiki-updates/">posts</a> by <a href="http://www.perlsofwisdom.net/">Ted James</a>
promoted some action and people at Socialtext (the company) promised to make some improvement to their wiki but in 
the meantime we had another trouble:

Apparently due to spam issues Socialtext closed <a href="https://www.socialtext.net/nlw/register.html">the registration</a> on the 
<a href="https://www.socialtext.net/">public Socialtext</a> installation. This is not really good for collaboration.

Luckily, Luke Closs, our secret and very friendly agent helped me to get some elevated rights so now I can send invitation to people. An that's the main
purpose of this blog entry to let you know that if you'd like to edit the wiki but don't have registration yet,
there are a number of people out there who can invite you. I don't know who are the others but I can do it. 

For now.
