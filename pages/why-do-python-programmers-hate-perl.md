=head1 Why do Python programmers hate Perl?

I have been programming Python for many years and I have been involved in the Python community for many years.

Every time someone finds out that I also write Perl and that I run the [Perl Weekly newsletter](https://perlweekly.com/) they make this face:

a mixture of pity, disbelief, disgust.

Where does it come from?

## Indoctrination

From an early age Python programmers are indoctrinated into hating Perl.

On page 18 of "Learning Python" is a full-page description of "Why is Perl bad".

For years if you went to a Python event, if they heard you were a Perl programmer there was a certain expectation to publicly express your dislike towards Perl, to express regret you ever touched it and show remorse.

I recall years ago, when I went to FOSDEM in Belgium, someone explained to me that at their company they won't hire anyone who has Perl in their resume, who has every written Perl. They won't hire them because they are tainted. They are ruined. They even have "logical" justifications. They said our mind-set was compromised by bad programming techniques.

## But why?

You would rightfully ask, why did they do this?

The first version of Perl was released in 1987, the first version of Python was released in 1991.

By the mid 90's Perl became a huge success. It brought totally new concepts to mainstream programming.
It made programming a lot easier and a lot more fun than it was before.

Python was nowhere. I can only imagine the envy the few Python programmers felt.

Python 2.0 was released in 2000, only then it started to gain substantial user-base.

I don't know when did they start the crusade against Perl.

Was it started by people who switched from Perl and felt they needed a justification?

Was it started by the Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python?

## Programming languages are like religions, tribes, or nations

For many people programming languages are just tools to accomplish tasks.

For many others programming languages also define their identity.

That's why some people say that they are "Perl programmers", "Python programmers" or "C programmers".
They even use titles as "Perl Mongers", or "Pythonistas" or "Rustaceans".

It seems many of us defined ourself by our tool-set rather than by the types of problems we can solve.

(e.g. "web programmer", "embedded programmer")

I know, for many years I called myself a "Perl programmer".
It did not stop me from looking at other languages, but was it good or bad? It certainly gave me some branding
so people knew, if they need help with Perl they can come to me. It also hurts me now as despite the fact that
I have been working with [Python](/python) for some 15 years and [Rust](/rust) for more than 2 years,
many people still only think about me in association with Perl only.


## They can't see the light

Python programmers feel that their language is better than Perl. The fact that some people don't see the light and still use the - in their opinion - inferior Perl - is outrageous. It offends them. It must be eradicated.


## TMTOWTDI - There's more than one way to do it

Despite the fact that I called myself "Perl programmer" I never felt the need to diss another programming language. Maybe that was part of my indoctrination to the TMTOWTDI.

So I like to say:

There's more than one way to do it and one of them is Python.
