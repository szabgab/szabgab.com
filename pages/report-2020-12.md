This is the report for December 2020. (See also the <a href="/reports.html">list of previous reports</a>).



<h2>Overview</h2>

I checked <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and felt I could not upload my courses there. Then I had the brilliant idea of trying the courses of
<a href="https://leanpub.com/">Leanpub</a> where I have been selling <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab">my books</a> for some time. It was very easy to
add my <a href="https://leanpub.com/c/bootcamp">Python Programming Bootcamp</a> and start selling. <a href="/programming-bootcamp.html">announced on December 3</a>.

Then came another brilliant idea to play on the idea of the Advent calendars and create both a Dancer and a Mojolicious course during the first 25 days of December.
(well, I was a bit late for the start, but I figured better late than never.) After recording a few episodes of Dancer I arrived to the conclusion that doing
both would be way too much work especially as I had a lot of other work to do. I <a href="/perl-dancer-course.html">announced the Dancer course</a> and published
the <a href="https://leanpub.com/c/dancer">Dancer course</a> on Leanpub.

After the initial day when I recorded some 5-6 videos I managed to record one or more videos every day so by now I have quite a lot of content in the course.

There were also about 60 people who bought either one of the courses. Again, not a huge number, not yet enough to cover the time I spent on it, but it is a very
encouraging start.

As I got really enthusiastic about that I started to create another course. However in the meantime I also started to feel that the current version of Leanpub is not
really good for the people who view the courses. Luckily I remembered that I am taking a <a href="/spanish.html">Spanish</a> course hosted on Teachable that looks
quite nice. So I looked around on <a href="https://teachable.com/">Teachable</a> and decided I'll give it a try.

Thus on 31 December, a few hours before the end of the year I've opened two of my <a href="https://courses.code-maven.com/">courses</a>:
The new <a href="https://courses.code-maven.com/p/perl-dancer-course">Perl Dancer course</a> and the even newer
<a href="https://courses.code-maven.com/p/functional-programming-in-python">Functional Programming in Python course</a>.

I even had a paying customer on them still in December 2020.

Then on January 1st 2021 I had a few more customers.

I am quite encouraged by this and this impacts my plans for January that you can see at the bottom of this page.


<h2>Personal blog posts</h2>

I started the month with 4 post on my <a href="https://szabgab.com/blog.html">personal site</a> but did not have time to continue.
Even though there were a few things I could at least announce. I hope I'll do better in January.

<h2>LinkedIn</h2>

For some strange reason in the middle of this month I was allocated 150 extra invitations to the Python page. I used them.
I also started to post a bit more to both the Python and the Perl pages, but I did not have enough energy to post to the DevOps
and Golang pages.

Nevertheless I am quite happy with the increase in the number of followers.

As I have started to create the video courses for Python, it starts to be a really good reason to invest a lot more energy in that page
along with the Perl page.

Number of followers:

  English:  526 (+10)
  Hebrew:   542 (+37)
  Spanish:   33 (-)
  Hungarian: 10 (+1)

  Perl:    569 (+74)
  Python:  386 (+95)
  DevOps:  323 (+15)
  Golang:  190 (+13)

  Personal: 4,114 (+25)

<h2>Twitter</h2>

Same as last month, I primarily posted in my two <a href="/twitter.html">main Twitter accounts</a>.

<h2>Facebook</h2>

I keep posting in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/">Perl programmers</a> group
and I like the feedbacks there.

<h2>Patreon</h2>

Finally I could start offering annual subscription via Patreon. Some of my supporters took the offer and even upgraded their support to a higher tier.

<ul>
<li>2020.12 ended with 66 Patrons and 8 followers</li>
<li>2020.11 ended with 69 Patrons and 6 followers</li>
<li>2020.10 ended with 66 Patrons and 6 followers</li>
<li>2020.09 ended with 63 Patrons and 6 followers</li>
<li>2020.08 ended with 54 Patrons and 6 followers.</li>
<li>2020.07 ended with 30 Patrons</li>
</ul>

See a partial <a href="/supporters.html">list of supporters</a>.

I lost one supporter because their financial situation changed, one because they are "channeling the funds elsewhere", and one because "too much Python".

I have posted 33 times in December. An improvement compared to the previous month, but I am now not sure if doing this is really a good idea.
I finished posting all entries of the <a href="https://code-maven.com/programming-boootcamp-for-scientists">Programming Boootcamp for Scientists</a> series
and started to post the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/dancer">Perl Dancer</a> series.

According to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/szabgab">Patreon page</a> there are now 79 videos, 1 writing and 1 link
available to the Patrons with $5 or more monthly support.

All the other posts are public.


<h2>Dev.to</h2>

I was not at all active on <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab">dev.to</a> in December

<h2>Perl Maven</h2>

On the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site there are 34 posts in December (14 in November, 5 in October).
Almost all of them for the Perl Maven Pro members.

You can see them in the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/archive">archive</a>.

<h2>Code Maven</h2>

On the <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code Maven</a> site there are 2 posts in December (7 November, 13 in October).
You can see them in the <a href="https://code-maven.com/archive">archive</a> there.

<h2>Perl Weekly</h2>

Nothing very exciting on the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> newsletter. I edited 2 of the issues
and <a href="http://www.manwar.org/">manwar</a> edited 2.

<h2>CPAN Digger</h2>

I have not done anything regarding the CPAN Digger in December. I think I got tired of the indifference of several people.
However the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/rt-cpan-org-is-closing">imminent closing of RT.CPAN.ORG</a> seemed to have
an impact in the good direction.

According to the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html">stats</a>  there is an improvement in the last 2 week.
I think it is primarily because of the closing of CPAN RT.

<h2>YouTube</h2>

I uploaded a number of videos, but they are all also published as pages on my other sites, so I should probably not count them here.
The number of followers on the various <a href="/youtube.html">YouTube channels</a>:

  English:   2,046 (+32)
  Hebrew:      113 (+17)
  Hungarian:     9 (-)
  Spanish:       6 (-)

<h2>Webinars and Meetups</h2>

This month I had two <a href="https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/">webinars in Hebrew</a> about Deploying Docker to the cloud
and about Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions.

For next month I've scheduled 3. One about Async Python and two about testing in Python.

<h2>Daily routine - Afternoon nap</h2>

Now that it is winter the evenings are a bit cold for my walking, so instead of that I started to have my almost daily walk during the day.
Around 1-1:30 I leave. When I get home I make a salad, warm the lunch (or wait till my wife or my daughter do their magic)
have lunch and soon after that I get really sleepy. So I take a shower and have an afternoon nap. Just to continue working later in the afternoon
and in the evening. Not bad, but I have no idea what I am going to do if I have to go to an office and work there the whole day or
teach in a class-room.

<h2>Spanish lessons</h2>

I have re-started learning Spanish with <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>. I am still afraid of the various past tenses,
but I decided I'll fake it if nothing else helps. Till now I was primarily doing the new exercises that were added to the first part of the
course. So it was not that difficult.

Starting on the 31 December I got back taking lessons on <a href="/spanish.html">Spanish</a> lessons via <a href="https://code-maven.com/italki">italki</a>.

I keep listening to podcasts in Spanish and I watched a few YouTube channels that are aimed to native Spanish speakers.

<h2>Hebrew</h2>

I kept improving my typing and spelling skills with Duolingo. I feel more and more confident writing even to real people.

<h2>Hiking</h2>

<a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/walking-trails/park-canada-62239028">Park Canada (Park Ayalon)</a> a short and not too steep walk.


<a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/walking-trails/nahal-sorek-cave-62827083">Above Nahal Sorek</a>

I planned for a longer walk, but left home late and also found out that the road is flooded and while car could cross I would get really wet.
So instead of the whole 18 km circle I had a much shorter walk. Only 9 km in less than 3 hours. In April-May I'll try it again.

<h2>Sport</h2>

According to <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> I went walking 18 times in December. Each time about 5.29 km.
My Speed is around 6km/h.


<h2>TODO</h2>

In January I'll spend again about 10 days working for long-term contract.
Currently I have a task that will also allow me to create a bunch of examples for a future Python course.

I don't know yet, but I might have 2 or 3 days with my Perl-training client writing tests for some old code.
That task will probably also lead to a few blog posts or slides in my Perl courses.

Post a video every day to my Patron subscribers. This will probably include the videos from the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/dancer">Perl Dancer</a>
course and the <b>Functional Programming in Python</b> course.

I would also like to post at least 5 videos publicly to the English YouTube channel.

I plan to run a poll on the Perl Maven LinkedIn page

I am going to finish recording the <b>Functional Programming in Python</b> course and I am going to record at least one another Python course.
I have plenty of ideas, just need to decide which one is next. I might run a poll on the Python page.
I might start a Perl course as well.

I would like to reach 520 followers on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-python/">Code Maven Python</a> LinkedIn page
and 600-620 followers on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/perl-maven/">Perl Maven</a> LinkedIn page. For that I'll need to share
a lot more content on both of those pages. The plan is to post at least once a day either to the Perl or to the Python page.

I really hope I'll be able to go for a few hikes. That partially depends on the weather and if the lockdown will be released.

Sport: keep walking every 2nd day or so.

Hike: 1-2 times, depending when the closure is lifted.

I made nice progress, but I have to further clean up my inbox.
