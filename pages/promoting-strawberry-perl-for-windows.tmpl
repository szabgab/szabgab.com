A few weeks ago Andy Lester suggested to
<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2009/06/promote-perl-6-by-saying-perl-5.html">Promote Perl 6 by saying "Perl 5"</a>. 
It's a pity most of the comments had to deal with the "Perl 6 is vaporware" meme. It is about as
mature as calling Perl dead.

Anyway, the other day I searched for 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=perl+for+windows">Perl for Windows</a> an noticed that 
Strawberry Perl is not in the top 10. So while I know the number of downloads for Strawberry Perl is 
growing I guess many people still don't find it.

One of the reasons for this I guess is that we always just refer to it as Strawberry Perl and
hardly mention the fact that it is for Windows. So I also would like to have a suggestions. 
If you mention Strawberry Perl in a blog or on a web site, please link to it as

<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/"><b>Strawberry Perl for Windows</b></a>

In time it will help get it to a higher position.

Thank you.
