Recently I was asked <b>What is Perl used for?</b>. I typed 
in the question in Google but I did not get a satisfactory answer. 
So I decided to spend some time wring up a list of fields and some example
application just to end up pointing to 3 much better lists.




<h2>Web site and web application development</h2>

Perl is one of the major players in this field though it makes
less noise than some of the other languages.

There are several modern frameworks for web applications development
in Perl such as <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a>, 
<a href="http://jifty.org/">Jifty</a>, 
<a href="http://mojolicious.org/">Mojo</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Titanium/lib/Titanium.pm">Titanium</a>.

In addition many companies maintaining their own stack of libraries
for writing their web application.

A couple of web applications that are written in Perl: 
<a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, 
<a href="http://openmelody.org/">Melody</a>,
<a href="http://www.webgui.org/">WebGUI</a>,
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>,
<a href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/">DreamWidth</a>,
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/">The Internet Movie Database</a> 
<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/">Ticketmaster</a>
and <a href="http://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a>.
Just to name a few.


<h2>Test Automation</h2>

Perl has an extensive test framework and tools to test 
any application regardless of the language that was 
used for the application. Perl can be used to test 
Web applications, Databases, Networking devices, 
File systems and even desktop applications. 
Just to name a few.

<h2>Configuration Management</h2>

Perl has been packaged with ClearCase and is the most common 
language to create the customization level connecting the
version control system, the build and packaging system with
the testing system and the bug tracking system.

<h2>System Administration</h2>

One of the original goals of Perl was to unify and 
replace all the small tools available on Unix. Today every 
Unix or Linux system comes with perl and many of them 
depend on perl to do all the tasks related to system management.

e.g.
<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a> is one of the
leading Spam filters.

<h2>Bioinformatics</h2>

I don't know much about bioinformatics but there is a wealth
of information for people in the field on the
<a href="http://www.bioperl.org/">Bioperl</a> web site. 
You might wan to start with the article on 
<a href="http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/How_Perl_saved_human_genome">
How Perl saved human genome</a>.

<h2>Desktop Application Development</h2>

Perl has less penetration in the Desktop application 
development market but there are at least three different 
toolkits to write cross-platform desktop applications.
Perl/Tk, 
<a href="http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/">Gtk2 Perl</a>, 
and <a href="http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/">wxPerl</a>.

There are several open source applications in each one of
the toolkits that you can see. 
e.g <a href="http://zim-wiki.org/">Zim, the desktop wiki</a>
is written in Gtk2 Perl while 
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a> 
is written using wxPerl.

<a href="http://remediecode.org/">Remedie</a> is a media player
written in Perl. It is a desktop application that runs in 
a browser.
  
<h2>Game Development</h2>

The original <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">Frozen Bubble</a>
is probably the most well known game written in Perl. It is using the
<a href="http://sdl.perl.org/">SDL Perl</a> framework that recently 
saw a surge of new development.


<h2>More fields and applications</h2>

There are many more applications listed on 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?applications">Perl Foundation wiki</a>,
on <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Perl_applications">Perl.net.au wiki</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Perl_software">Perl software on Wikipedia</a>

<a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/09/applications-for-normal-users.html">Applications for Normal Users</a>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Perl is used in many fields, some that were mentioned here and some 
that were not. If you think there are other fields that could be 
mentioned here, please let me know.
