This was the same to many people before they organized one.

So step up and organize a local event!



Start with a <a href="http://pm.org/">Perl Monger</a> meeting.

Have a common goal. (e.g. a shared project, creating a web application to your local pm group).
Or creating a <a href="http://perlmaven.com/perl-tutorial">Perl Tutorial</a> in your language.
(Hint, you could help translating the one linked there.)

Get a (local?) company (that might be looking for Perl programmers) to sponsor your meetings.
(the venue, the food, the drinks etc.) an <b>you</b> will provide the content.

<b>Be persistent.</b>

<b>Get started now.</b>
