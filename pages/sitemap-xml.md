In the post about <a href="/marketing-and-promotion.html">Marketing and Promotion</a> I mentioned that I found out that this site does not have a <a href="/sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a>.
I've add it now. Added it to the <a href="/robots.txt">robots.txt</a> as well and submitted in to <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster</a>.

And now I looked at this short post and it looks quite bad on the site.

So I might want to add some more text.

More importantly I've noticed that the Copyright information had 2019 in it while we are already in 2020. It is hard-coded in the HTML template so I had to update it.

Looking at the Webmaster report of the Code-Maven site it says I have bad dates in the file. I need to fix that!
