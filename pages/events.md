People over Tools.

Tech conferences are great to listen to presentations and to mingle with fellow engineers, but usually they don't provide a good place to really get to know each others. Attendees, and especially the speakers have little time to talk to each individual.

Having a much more relaxed environment can have a substantial impact on communication that can lead to cooperation.



Spending a few hours together in the nature or walking around the city is an excellent opportunity 
for organizers, speakers, and participants to talk to each other in a more natural environment.

That's why, I am organizing outdoor events around tech conferences.

A few examples:

<h2>Budapest, Hungary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hike in the hills on the outskirts of Budapest. See the plan to <a href="/hiking-after-craft-2017.html">Hike after Craft Conference 2017 in Budapest</a> and my <a href="/craft-conf-2017.html">Craft Conf 2017 retrospective</a></li>
<li>Hike in the hills of <a href="/hiking-after-craft-2018.html">Budapest after Craft Conf 2018.</a></li>
<li>Visiting Szentendre</li>
</ul>

<h2>Israel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sight-seeing in Jerusalem (primarily old city)</li>
<li>Hiking in the mountains of Jerusalem</li>
<li>Hiking in Nachal David near Ein Gedi, swimming in the Dead Sea</li>
