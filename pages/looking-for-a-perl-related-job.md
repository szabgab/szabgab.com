If you are looking for a Perl related job I am sure you already know about
<a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a>. You might say there
are not many job posts there or that there are no posts there from your
country. So here is a suggestions that might help both you and the others
in the Perl community.

Use whatever service to locate companies that need a Perl programmer, eg.
use <a href="http://indeed.com/">indeed.com</a> or whatever is used in your
country. For every company you find that is looking for a Perl programmer,
write an e-mail and tell them they can post their open position on 
<a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a> free of charge.

Do this in the header mail of your application. By helping the recruiter
in her/his task to find a Perl programmer and by showing you are not afraid
of them finding other people you will immediately increase your chances to
be invited to an interview.

Do this even if you don't want to apply to them specifically. That can 
help another Perl programmer and the Perl community in general.
