While <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MattCutts">Matt Cutts</a> from Google says that <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/google-1ranking-17252.html">+1s Don't Improve Rankings</a> it seems that sharing on Google+ has a huge impact.

After a little experiment Michael Q Todd showed
<a href="http://www.michaelqtodd.com/googleplus-search-wenyard">How to rank 2nd + 3rd in a keyword (Wenyard) in 3 days with Google+ posts</a>.

Of course he saw that result while he was logged in to Google, which means he was in his own bubble.

After seeing his <a href="https://plus.google.com/115818365607064275331/posts/e3hmHeBrxxz">post on Google+</a> about this I tried to search for the 
keyword <b>wenyard</b> and have not seen his share. Then I added <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MichaelQToddThe7PillarsBook">Michael Q Todd</a>
to one of my circles and searched again. That time I already saw his share of wenyard on Google+.

Then, just to play a bit more, I removed him from my circle and after a few minutes searched again. The link disappeared from the results.  
Adding him back to the circle and the link came back as the 3rd hit.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Google will rank Google+ shares of people in your circle very high.

This sounds logical. The assumption is that you will want to hear the opinion of people you are following.

<h2>TODO</h2>

If you'd like to promote a link, for example the <a href="http://perl-tutorial.org/">Perl Tutorial hub</a>, then share it on Google+
with the hash-tags #perl and #tutorial, and get people with lots of followers on Google+ to do the same.

This won't get more people to use Perl, but it will get more people who are already searching for <b>perl tutorials</b>
to find ones that are recommended by the Perl community.

I just did that on the <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/102874059713383300948/">Google+ page</a> of the
<a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly newsletter</a>.

Same with any other topic.
