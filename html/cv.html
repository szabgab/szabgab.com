            <li>Before I started to teach students in 2018 I taught several courses to the researchers and the internal system team.</li>
            <li>Every semester there is 1, sometimes 2 sessions of the "Programming Bootcamp for Scientists" course</li>
            <li>At first if was a 5-days long 8 hours a day intensive session before the semester.</li>
            <li>During COVID I recorded the whole content of the <a href="https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists">Programming Bootcamp for Scientists</a></li>
            <li>Since then the course is back in the class-room. This time 5 half-days before the semester and 5 half-days in the first 5 weeks of the semester.</li>

    <td><b>Independent DevOps Engineer, Developer, and Trainer</b>
      <p></p>
        <b>Some of the services provided by Gabor</b>
        <ul>
           <li>Introducing Unit~, Integration~, and Acceptance testing.</li>
           <li>Introcuding best practices for Version Control Systems.</li>
           <li>Developing and introducing test automation frameworks.</li>
           <li>Setting up Continuous Integration using Jenkins, Travis-CI, Bamboo, Bitbucket Pipelines, or a set of in-house tools.</li>
           <li>Setting up Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.</li>
           <li>Converting teams to use Virtualization (Docker, Vagrant+VirtualBox).</li>
           <li>Implementing Continuous Learning practices.</li>
           <li>Introducing Pair programming.</li>
           <li>Handling cloud infrastructure (Google, Amazon, Linode, Digital Ocean).</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Some of the Contract Works I've Done</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Moving several systems from Amazon AWS to Google GCP. Creating a labeling system for entities in GCP for a
          cost reporting system. Helping to reduce cloud expenses. Resizing Elasticseach clusters.
          Convertiung a build and testing system from TeamCity to Jenkins using a mix of Groovy, Bash, and Python.
          Building a Python Flask based reporting system for data in PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Solr systems.
          </li>
          <li>Implementing and in-house agent-less CI system for a company that uss various small boards
          (eg. Firefly, Artik, and some Android based devices). Building a CI and release system.</li>
          <li>Implementing the API of 3rd party services in order to make it easier to test an application using that API.
          To test how to application behaves when the 3rd party application fails. When it response slower than expected.
          When it returns "out of quota" errors. etc.</li>
          <li>Installing Jenkins as in-house Continuous Integration system. Introducing unit-testing in Python.</li>
          <li>An in-house web-application to provide tools for the engineers to compare images.
             I used the Perl Dancer framework while the data was kept in PostgreSQL.
             The front-end was using Bootstrap and JQuery.</li>
          <li>An application aggregating data about mobile applications from the Apple Appstore, Google Play,
             and various vendors that provide information about those applications. The data was provided
             in various formats, including CSV, XML, and JSON based feeds and APIs.
             The collected data was stored in a MySQL database and served via our own JSON based API and using JavaScript snippets.
             When I arrived and initial version of the application worked collecting data from one source
             and using CGI to serve the data.  I've converted it to PSGI and created the system that was
             able to accommodate data from various sources in various formats. I used Perl Moo for OOP. Later we converted the application to Python and Django.</li>
          <li>An application to be used on Amazon Mechanical Turk. This was JavaScript based using JSON
             files for data storage without any additional back-end.</li>
          <li>An in-house application generating Excel reports from data in a PostgreSQL database to provide Business Intelligence.
              This project was built using Perl</li>
          <li>A workflow management application to control the whole workflow of an in-house image processing and analysis system.
              This was implemented in Perl handling a number of data formats (CSV, XML), connecting to web-based APIs via HTTP and
              to a PostgreSQL database.</li>
          <li>Refactored a code-base used for in-house test-automation that when I arrived had about 4,000,000 lines of Perl code.</li>
          <li>Lots of log and database analysis code to provide data for Munin-based monitoring system. Mostly Perl with some Python.</li>
          <li>Took over the maintenance and further development of an event-based application written in Perl. The application was monitoring the
              file system for Excel files uploaded by the users. Then it analyzed and converted the Excel files to XML files that needed to be injected
              in a Java-based application. The results were then received in XML format and had to be converted back to Excel. The queues were using
              an SQLite database.</li>
        </ul>
