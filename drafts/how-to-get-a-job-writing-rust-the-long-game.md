=head1 How to get a job writing Rust? - The long game

It seems to me there are a lot of people out there who know Rust at various levels who would love to get a job writing Rust,
but can't find one.

Some complain that most of the jobs are in Cryptocurrency or other uses of Blockchain.

The obvious answer to this would be then to also learn about Cryptocurrency or in general Blockchains and get such a job, but I understand that some people are less interested in that field.
That itself is a whole expertise quite different from back-end development, mobile application development, or embedded development.

Instead of switching your are of expertise I'd ask: What will make more companies in my area of expertise want to use Rust. What's stopping them for doing so?
