A large part of the industry still thinks that writing automated test by the developers slows down the development process.

This is understandable as people who have not experienced a smooth(!) system of automated tests will think that by letting the developers write tests in
addition to the code of the application we somehow make them spend more time overall. However, people who have already experienced good systems with plenty
of unit and integration tests know that they actually spend less time overall developing new features. Even while they write both the code and the tests.

There are a couple of reasons for this seemingly contradiction. For one, writing tests will make developers write simpler and shorter code.
They will also spend a lot less time fixing bugs.
