=head1 Using LinkedIn to create opportunities

I don't consider myself and expert on LinkedIn, so take my ideas with a grain of salt. I don't claim that this is the right solution for you or even a good solution.

I wanted to build opportunities to be invited to provide services in Rust and Python, and also help companies using Perl. Especially in Israel, where I live.

* Created a LinkedIn group for [Rust in Israel](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12915149/).
* Searched the international [Rust Programming Language](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4973032/) group that has 27,465 members for names that sound Israeli. As groups allow you message each other even if you are not connected I used that feature to send private messages to them and invited them to our group.
* Searched among my first-level connections who mentioned Rust and are located in Israel and invited them to the group. At first I used the invite feature of the group, but then I started to send DMs to the relevant people with a few words and link to the group.
* I went over the members of the [Rust in Israel](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12915149/) group. Asked them one-by-one if they use Rust for work. I also invited them to connect directly.
* Searched for my 2nd and 3rd level connectsion who mention Rust and are located in Israel. Sent them an connect request and invited them to our group.


* Meetup group admins


On LinkedIn regular users can only send a very limited number of invitations with text every month. I think 5 per month. LinkedIn pro members - even in the <strike>cheapest</strike> least expensive version of it seem to be able to send an unlimited number of connection requests with text. I tried it first for one months and then I decided I'll pay it for a year. We'll see if it and this whole contact-building is worth it.
