Originally this was a web application written in Perl. Then at one point I arrived to the conclusion that it does not need to be live so I convereted it to be a static site generator.
Still in Perl.

Originally the format of the files was some strange html-ish format with `.tmpl` extension and a strange-looking front-matter. (It was inspired by the tags of the Perl POD.)

Then I implemented a Markdown-based format so the newer files are already in this format. Still using the same front-matter. I've even converted some of the older files to this format.

When I have time I might convert all the old posts to Markdown and replace the front-matter with something I used in the new [Code Maven SSG](https://ssg.code-maven.com/).

I might also need to check all the old and broken links leading to projects and web sites that are gone. I am just not sure what to do with them? Shall I just remove the links and keep the text?
